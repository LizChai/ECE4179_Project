Now what bothers me the most
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' t-to
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
There's darkness closing in (evil twin)
One day for every pill
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
These are the things that we must go through
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
To find babbling Max, gaffling tracks
Terror to the business, married to the strippers, T-Pain
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend?
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
Baby, please come back
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt
While everybody is watching in the party applauding it
Why did we have to break up? All I asked for was a glass of punch
Yeah I got something I want to share.
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
Nobody asked for life to deal us
Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
While juggling waffles baking
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
To avert a disaster
I'm not your husband (Nah), you ain't my girlfriend
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
Change the station I hate this song!
Boy hit the beat & just treat that shit like it's a diary
When you retards can roll the dice
On "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP
'Cause you can get it like over the counter (Yo)
I've been sipping on like, vodka (Head's numb)
I've been sipping on like, vodka (Head's numb)
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie
You really did a number on me
As intense as I do and the irony
(He can't say whore)
Assume the position and get back down on your knees - c'mon
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have,
You can even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
That another nigga got you? They didn't see skills
OK then! Everybody, listen up!
Like nut on your spine
the whole city of Detroit
Yeah, uh
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
Flipped out, ripped down the drapes
THEY BEEF 'N WE LEAVING 'EM COKED UP!!!
Rap God spit lyrical bullets (pew!)
And I knew it but Proof isn't here to see me through it
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
OK
So read up, about how I used to get beat up
They say I'm a spoiled little baby
The day he gave me that shot when I was just 'bout to quit
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Drinkin', cussin', and hyper smilin'
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
How can I moonlight on the side?
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
Shit's finna get thick again
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Weezy keep ya head up,
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently
It's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept
Inappropriate? So be it, I don't see it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
Shake-speare, so what if insults are revoltin'
But kissed them old days, adios, I did it
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
Now that was awesome
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Glad bags, yeah glad to be back, 'cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dead in rehab
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on boo
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked
You wanna butt heads? Shut up, Beavis, ha ha
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, "The Vapors"
Take a day off or what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel
Something I won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions, so it's over
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough
The only way to see me is if you lookinâ€™ up from down below
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough
It'd be Jennifer Lopez - and Puffy, you know this
So at night before I sleep I look in the mirror
plot is thickenin' worse, cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a
Oh well, this is my life so
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
You want what you can't have
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother,
Got nothin' to do with me
Got nothin' to do with me
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm kinda in the zone
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
"Ding-dong," the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
I'm cold buzzin', I never been low budget
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians
Gag-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ag
But that isn't scaring us.
When you gonna learn how much money weâ€™ve earned
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I can see that he's just a punk 
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
In that video she sings, "Get out, you bozo.
Ha ha
She said, "No, your music"
You'll get the hint, ho: I'm in your window
Or should I sound cranky and bitter
her, you never would expect that blow, Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low,
It's unfortunate but it's
But I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
So me and you are not alike
And ruined your welcome mat
Jessica Simpson, looks oh so temptin'
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
Invite them in like a One A Day
they coming with bombs, I'm coming with flare-guns
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
Dyke ho, you don't like it
Ffff-fuck...(My dick!) my nuts..
And a piece of plastic bubble wrap
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
Quit horsin' around in this building or you a goner
Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of 'em off
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
background reveals a 1-8-7-2, 'till the block I'm the truth, to the cops I'm the proof
Stay wide awakeMotherfuckers talkin' crazy (yeah)
So I don't plan on stopping at all
So I don't plan on stopping at all
So I don't plan on stopping at all
So I don't plan on stopping at all
So I don't plan on stopping at all
Just stay true to you so
Just stay true to you so
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
I love your personality
I rip (mystikal's) voicebox out, scream in his ear (Ahhhhhh!)
And go about your life, like it was nothing
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
A super bonanza extravaganza.
Put down the scissors, 'fore you do something dumb
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
(Mushrooms killed Kenny! *fart* Ewww, ahhh!)
Ever ever
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is
I done messed around and forgot my TEC
Maybe I'm just ahead of myself
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
For every single die hard fan who embraced me
I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
Cuffing, I'm shoving the girl I love inside of an oven
Hypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Then I let you go and just give
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog?
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
Thank you, God
Yeah, I feel it too.
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow, man
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog
Cause I'll hit yo' ass like the train did that bitch
And it's time to wash out the blonde
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Unlike you 'cause you're on a flight too, but it's a staircase
I'm tired of the games I just want her back
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no.
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, hope you can swim good!
Please, undo your seatbelt for takeoff
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
'Cause we ain't come to hurt no one (one)
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan' (Ayo)
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
Not just based on my description
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
'Cause Dre couldn't make it today
It's still all right cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
There's a baby sister in the mix,
I'm gonna fucking cum
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Than those other little hoes
Young Money...
You don't have to, agree
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin they funds
Straighten up little soldier
You better run and tell someone else,
Everything is so tense and gloom
Girl, you think you're so smart
Girl, you think you're so smart
Girl, you think you're so smart
Girl, you think you're so smart
But especially when you don't know
Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up
and watch mosh pits til motherfuckers knock each other unconcious
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Get your brains blown out
Shit becomes too much to bear
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
They cannot tame or placate the (Ayy)
He kicked it in
But this time I
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
They belong in my scrotum,
Cookie looky, even took me a Polaroid
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
His cup just runneth over, oh no
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
Now we're pouring liquor on the curb in his name for him
Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Some girls are bout it bout it
I wanna fuckin' sing
You write normal? Fuck being normal
The Alaina to my Hailie.
Metaphors wrote on my hand,
It gets all quiet and whispers
Sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more?
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin another bomb 
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
I see those cheeks soaking and wet
Chargin' me, so I gave my hotel key
Tell the critics I'm back and coming to spit it back in abundance
Even if it is Charles Manson who just happens, to be rapping
To tell 'em what's on my mind
To tell 'em what's on my mind
How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
Now just wait 'til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
But I'm contemplating yelling "Bombs away" on the game
Go, go, go!
Love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
I think i'm bottomin' out
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
I keep trying to pass it
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
She don't want to see me with other females out
And no, we ain't pumpkins on Halloween
(I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better)
Listen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
I'm an enigma
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Slim Shady would be somethin that you woulda bought
it's just me being me, here want me to tone it down?
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat
That ain't no reason to start wigging and spaz out
Is you rely on me as much
3 A.M. in the mornin'
Oh yeah
I shoveled shit all my life,
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
New boobs? (Yeah) Where you get them done?
You missing the key, you ain't even in the brisk of the tea
I'll get you there
Now here I am three months later full blown relapse
This little cock-sucker, he must be feelin' himself
"John, where's Dave at before I bash you?"
It feels like I'm talking to myself
It feels like I'm talking to myself
It feels like I'm talking to myself
It feels like I'm talking to myself
You did it, it's your fault
It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?
Ready, set, go! Hit play, record!
And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders.
Yeah, you're a cute fox
A bitch-made man; now, how you gonna connect
Stand above em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Damage already done, y'all should've let me be
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
When you find out, can't escape me whore.
Have Micheal Myers looking like a liar, swipe his powers
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
Ha! Go ahead, yell!
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Come and see me on the streets alone
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
Children quiet down please
Lyrics coming at you with supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
Outsiders, and we suing the courts
I keep on telling you motherfuckers
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
tunk, pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaners, fucked me good, you should of
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
The more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves
DRE! (AH-AH)
did I spit too soon?
It's true that I got shot in the heart
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Especially when the Worlds silly putty in ya hands, its playdough
When you walked through the door you were queer to me
I've caused a few and so have you
But I can't see who he's shooting it out with
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
We got schoolcraft here at the seven-eight and dexter,
To remind me
Wish there wasn't any pain,
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover, 'cause he need it
Last year I was nobody
We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
but I'm too swift and fast
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe {*wolf whistle*}
Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
Body's bananas and sass to go wit'
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?
Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, they'll call me guilty
His son just woke up and he just walks in
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just,
Helplessness
If I bet you, I'll be in tomorrow's paper
You think your hot, you aint even luke warm
Big L got blasted away
I'm lifting you 10 feet (lifting you 10 feet)... in the air
So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn bitches)
Man, here we go
Man, here we go
Man, here we go
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
It's type weird 'cause that made me hotter than my dear
(Six minutes, six minutes)
I buried the Christ corpse
I can carry rap til my back hurts
The door's broken, it won't lock
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square
Finger so high in the air, I bet your senses flip
Me and Dre the steel alloys,
Its all an illusion
Cause the DJ playin' my song
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me
'Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both
So you might wanna go back to the lab tonight and um
Me too, you're burning up
Me too, you're burning up
Me too, you're burning up
A never-was, been claiming rap when it's not yours
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fucking G
My signature ligature marks, look at you all
I ain't "acid rap", but I rap on acid
I'll blow my brains in your lap
So. this. time. I'm goin' in!Obie, yo', i'm sick, damn, you straight dog...
If you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
We ain't friends trying to make amends
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
Our apartment's tore apart
For me to flip
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
From a daddy longleg
No way I'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wed us
the only thing i wait for
'Til I feel anointed
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
Eminem killed by M and M
but if you go back and
None of these skills you bout to see come free
None of these skills you bout to see come free
None of these skills you bout to see come free
None of these skills you bout to see come free
And Irv's so nervous that he
Everybody doin' chick joints
Worth sneaking out to me, the cheap hotel rooms or
Or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and I
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Suck my dick, you fucking suck bitch
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
With methamphetamines in his left hand
'Cause if you doubt me you will, yeah got me a pill, found me a thrill
This is how I'm supposed to be
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylenol
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I think I'm down to a hundred pounds.
Or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?
It's like we're playing lyrical tug of war with your ear. You hear it girl, come here.
Wanted one though, they were so dope (Yeah)
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Oh they can all get fucked.
Oh they can all get fucked.
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Cinderella man
Mom, I know I let you down
Oh, critiquin' my talent?
Deformed fool,taking a shit in a warm pool
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
This the life of a rocker
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
All of a sudden I got 90 some cousins (Hey it's me!)
Knock knock, let the devil in
and yell out loud, "All y'all get the hell out now"
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
I never meant to bring you to my world
I never meant to bring you to my world
I never meant to bring you to my world
I never meant to bring you to my world
I never meant to bring you to my world
I never meant to bring you to my world
I never meant to bring you to my world
I never meant to bring you to my world
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (and she will)
And have some back and forths
By saying shady was ghost I aint even close the gate
Lesson three: Get a job at a label; switch demos with canibus
And all at once just to have somethin' to chew...
I know that makes you real mad, don't it? (Uh-Huh)
Uh, here â€“ DOUBLE XL, DOUBLE XL
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
But then she comes back to me
But then she comes back to me
Eminem and Fuzz, and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
You feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, you're pissed
I've been to bat for this woman
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
Fuck all you
You couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula
'Cause you've been a gold digger since you was a miner
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
This is do or die
This is do or die
This is do or die
This is do or die
Pretending to be blind Superman
(Oh, my God!)
Beating him over the head with the telephone
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform
Left the house, pullin' out the drive backin' out
You end up going out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid
"Regime" is a little extreme
"No one's gonna love you like I do!"
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet.
I'll be standin by the Loch Ness Monster (okay) peace out (bye!!)"
Cause of nervousness that was solely the only verdict
Cause of nervousness that was solely the only verdict
Six semen samples, 17 strands of hair
Make a beeline
I won't have to rape you
Dreamin at night of screamin at mom, schemin to leave
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
I asked him to come to the dark side
I'll shit on you!
Drugs, rock and Hennessy
But in fact
How does it feel: Is it fantastic, is it grand?
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
You got no hitters, you might be pitchin' a shut out
But I think it's workin'
Couldn't agree with ya more, If you were to say that my fuckin shit doesn't stink,
Yeah, boy; let them demons out!
I done said so much fucked up shit, I was born a mistake
Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at,
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
Making his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a motherfucking
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Like the shade in these windows
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
I just tripped over my cape (Superman)
Sippin' Bacardi and lime I start to recollect on the time
All you have is a little stupid can
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol
I say you know, you acting like you don't know
Don't let up, just keep slaying em
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
You're only making this harder on yourself
And to the Republic for which it stands
One to ten shit I must be the holy grail of
Born and raised in the C-P-T, yeah Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva what can you do?
Plus a luxury sedan
With a night pass to the matinee
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Slashin your tires, flyin down Fenkel and Meyers
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
Got your whole crew doing subpeonas
Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.
Who the fuck are you, Superman?
I'm so gone off the hookah
Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina, too.
And we ain't stoppin' until
My inner strength
No shit (Oh)
But I did have a super power though
How come your shirt is so bloody?
How come your shirt is so bloody?
How come your shirt is so bloody?
Enough rhymes to
Yeah!
Sprayin' wreck (Bitch!)
That's about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset
Obie Trice, D-12, G Unit, 50 Cent, Hailie Jade
So nice to meet you
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous
You're fuel to my fire
Nothing like Son of Sam, so please understand
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
But they're really your enemies, with secret identities
And on and on and on (and on and on)Yeah.
So focused on the bright side
You see I never really asked for much
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair
Puffy is good, (Hey!) but Slim Shady is for the children! (Wait!)
Killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent
I'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumbling back
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
Am I trying to show her how? Let me slow it down some. It's still gonna be a blow out.
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
But I've still got a lot of growing up to do
And I give you the news with a twist
I don't cut the beat 'til I fuckin' destroy it
I murk her with a Mossberg
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
Of trying to fake
They after that Shady - Aftermath money
Swing one last time
Kiss my dick, get my cash
Look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug!" (Sorry!)
And I'mma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm tired of not having a phone
All this tension dispensing these sentences
Eminem you wait till' we meet up again
I'm like houdini,
Pull up behind you while you're leaving and you don't even know it (ayo, Rick, man)
Always pullin' devices
If they were brown, Shady lose, Shady sits on the shelf,
Strapped with a grenade, in the pool with your mama
Just about, belted out whatever spouted or fell out my smart aleck mouth it was so weird
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
There aint no boy who can do what I do boy I'm a star,
And I ain't playin', you a brother getting cheated
I'm a glutton for punishment
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
So don't blame me (evil twin)
The plan's to bring you to my house
So come here baby boy, just come here to me
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
It's a trap, fuck my last CD the shit's in my trash,
And for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life
You can act a fool if you wanna (bitch)
I need scope 'cause my breath stinks
Next time you'd show restraint
Who would've thought I could ever be such a relentless prick
'Cause I related to the struggles of Young America
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
And I'm frozen 'cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
Used to be my fiancÃ©e, 'til you sucked on Wayne, AndrÃ© and Kanye,
Unleashing his vengeance
Besides static pain and Big Daddy Kane
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white

Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?
You felt my heat, rubbing off on you
for anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
Perform the home abortion with Dexter
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
But I'ma make you eat your words

I'm sliding down a slippery slope
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Michael would like an apology what
And love is "evol"
I don't give a fuck who you are
The devil only knows of this world
With the stress this game is giving me... 
My pair ol' shoot like sky divin' in Hammer pants
Tin brain, prolly fucked in the membrane
Am I too nice?
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
You better be strapped with a derringer
When it happened I had an epiphany
With the stress this game is giving me...
What do you have in common?
Slim Shady shit sounds like a fable to me
And you're looking way thinner
The way that you turned your back on me
They should have never let us get off foot in this game...
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
What else can I do, I haven't got a clue
These niggas is trippin'
The only way that I am able
But neither one of us would ever admit it,
Talking about I fabricated my past
But she wasn't aware, I was there, or maybe she was, and just didn't care
(don't know what I'm gonna do)
To speak and be heard
Lately I really feel like I'm rolling for delf like Philly,
I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Pick up lighteninâ€™ bolts and throw â€˜em
I think I'll put a piece of art on my visa card,
I come home every single day from working double shifts
But what good is a fuckin' recovery if I fumble it?
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
I trust that everyone is enjoying the music
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac
Wait is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
When I'm layin' here with you,
I sees three little kids, up in the front row,
I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real
In fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em
Your VCR tape cases with you Ambient CR great places to hide ain't it
Promising complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
It's they who mistake me and make me so angry
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
When will the madness end, how can it when
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
I'm like Two-Face, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
DJ Polo, Tony D, ODB, Moe Dee, Run-DMC
And through my hair when ordeals I'm so vain
Cause all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had
It's something to see
In the arm and pay homage, pupil
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
Give every kid who got played that
And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
when they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet (Huh?)
I think about the things I would've never got to say to you.
but his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
Never looking back
Who just happened to be a rapper
I said, "Go with you where?" She said "Out"
I'm sorry mama!

Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW!
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I just love condoms and lots of cum, no? Oh, shit.Ballin' Uncontrollably
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow
She cut me off on the freeway
To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
And I ain't talking 'bout a pencil
I think I might just do something a little less subtle,
Man chill, nah I can't god dammit
You can see the sparks from hot metal
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me
Who the fuck's Milo?
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
Bitch I'mma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
You weren't supposed to agree, you fucking bitch!
I became a hypocrite
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
As the blade I push into captcha
Iâ€™m so up, Iâ€™m stuck in mid air Iâ€™m lovinâ€™ it yeah
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
The enforcer, look at the more women to torture
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, haha

Here today, gone tomorrow
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody
I find the package and I'm cool,
and beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
I could sweat her to some degree
Gave alyssa milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea (You're a dick!)
We fear how we feel inside
We fear how we feel inside
Right outside of the window of my living room
i got a million bucks in the banks and 8 trucks
Okay, let me see, how could I begin?
But you pushed me to the limit. What a pity
Spin, grab Denaun's guitar and Honky Tonk ya
That's why I'm swingin' at these chicks on-site
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic
So what you hollering and yelling about
So you might not hear sirens at all
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope
Fucking lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Creep with me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane
D.M.C. we have a mid 30s male
Me and my man Howard and Butta would go to the mall with 'em
It's like. you. don't. want. me to win
It's like. you. don't. want. me to win
It's like. you. don't. want. me to win
It's like. you. don't. want. me to win
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Severin, legs, arms, damn there goes another limb
'Cause I never went gold off one song
Someone's gonna touch my body
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
You wouldn't do what,
Like an Air Conditioning knob
Panic attack cause I'm claustrophobic
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love
You're only twenty-four but you're plenty more mature
Then there's really nothin else to say (sing along)
You feelin' blue, too late
Whipping human ass, throwing blows, cracking jaws
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Three's not a crowd all up in it, slow fire
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like
I put that on everything like ranch, I'll never land
You're a supernova... and I'm a
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
We waited in the blistering cold for you
Screaming "fuck, shit, fuck"
Don't snap, it's supposed to be grabbed
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour
(Sorry!)
Payroll (Nice), might put you on a table
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
Mush the Senate's face and push this generation
His life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (pew)
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
To have one last heart-to-heart
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
BTOV
Remember me? ("I drop bombs like Hiroshima")
Like a win-window
Like a win-window
Like a win-window
In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin once
And stop interrupting you're not even up in the conversation
I'd never get to make it right. So, here's what I came to do.
I'm the beatiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went!
and started helpin him stomp me
is all we need in this world
is all we need in this world
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo...
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Underground, pop, or nameless, whatever your job is
Think you spit the rawest
Long time since I shouted them out, bout time
So rest in peace to Bugz and proof
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Because what's stolen from me barely broke even
ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on fifty it's funny
Boo!
'Til your bones poke through your skin
Of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic
We ain't the same, you and I
There's no need to say shit you already know
There's no need to say shit you already know
There's no need to say shit you already know
There's no need to say shit you already know
There's no need to say shit you already know
the rest of us follow suit
the rest of us follow suit
I stood up and said, "Fuck you punk" and I took off and ran
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
It's the time of the season, when hate runs high
And square dance with me!
And square dance with me!
And square dance with me!
And square dance with me!
And square dance with me!
And to anybody I thought about going at, it was never nothing personal, just some shit I was going through
Took a stab in the dark and broke the tip
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
I'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.
I'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.
I'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.
I'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.
I'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.
I'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.
Escaping me, no dice, you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Fine nobody wants to play with me 
Ah Wait a minute
But so what this beef is like 
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Anywhere else in the world right now
Looking to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
He's been praying for me
So blatantly, but silently 'cause I know that she's sound 'sleep
And while you're burning the past, standing in the inferno and chant
His fuckin' dad walkin' out
(rape your mother, kill your parents)
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
But I am coming for closure
Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
I don't need you as much as I really need you
cause those're my best
Or be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
If I don't try to record as much before I do
Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully search the den
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
I said "What is it, another nigga? It's ok"
Pass the hot dogs (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?)
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop
I still love your mother, that'll never change.
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd fans
When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)
When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)
When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)
When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)
I'd yank my fucking teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue
Speak of the devil  It's attack of the rain man 
I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (uh-huh huh)
I wonder what's on the tube
Did you find someone new?
Did you find someone new?
Alright, I'mma lay the chorus first
I just adapt to the climate, I treat it like my Levi's
And your own fans are laughin' at you?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Have I sold it cheap is it greed
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
if 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
But that's how she attracts men, though
Hit every single store, flash a fucking wad of cash
You're my entire supply
And at the end of my run
I'll do it, pop and gobble it and start wobblin'
To the new, Que SerÃ¡
Okay, yeah
You always rap first, 
With sugar plums.
(bust it bust it)
I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne
A secret passageway around here man there's got to be one
How far will he take it?
How far will he take it?
How far will he take it?
How far will he take it?
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story,
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why.
Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch
Turn me into
Uncle Marshall!
They took away dinner (chooka)

Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo

Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Can't, specifically describe it I just can't seem to give a reason
Them haters hatin on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
And blew up my-my-myself again
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Who's itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than chris-topher
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
("Grady!")
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
FUCK THAT! PBBT! You faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
Space Jam Jordans
Or am I truly psychotic, or my molecules just diabolical,
Come back and shoot the club up with a fo'-fo' (a fo'-fo')
I never saw him run so fast in my life
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
I won't give up
There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this

You hear the beat as it makes you not wanna go to sleep.
To this day I, still get in fights with the same broad
Don't want to, I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
Other side of my back and stuck a spike, too, should've
I cut 'em off, I got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
I'd laugh while you wept
In Harlem
Don't have to prove anything
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
He don't owe them bitches shit
I need a change of pace 'cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
"Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
(Hey, hey, hey!)
Man! (I swear!)
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Ha ha, you feel that baby?
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tell flaw with heat
I got my hands on something great
I got my hands on something great
Gettin' recruited at eighteen
Everybody halts and stops, and calls the cops
They make it all up, there's no such thing
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
Who ain't have shit to do with it, like Cool J does (My tattoo!)
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Look at, Kim
Eat a fuckin' dick (yeah)
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I wouldn't, not even if I could
Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
And sit up front; I'm not asking, it's a trap
Ready to snap any moment I'm

Ready to snap any moment I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
Word to Uncle Ron
He's not a desperado he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Girl, you give me writer's block
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans, exploding
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying
Other day someone got all elaborate
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
I won't topple I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
I consider me and Nickel identical, but not us
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself
Sipped it on the way out as I dipped, I wanna rip the road up
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
And you think I'm gross and unsexy
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a Jeep full of people
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension
Must've been true because man we done banned they shoes
And make her fall on her face and
Half you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage, rest of you got lap bands
It's OK to be scared-straight they said I provoked queers
It'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way
The more you, put me through,
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
Fuck you
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
But I am trying to find a way to get you alone (car note)
And maybe that's a bad habit.

So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
Ever heard of Aspergers'? It's a rare condition
Everyone's got 'em, thought that you were Cinderella but (Yeah)
Better text message your next of kin, tell em shits about to get extra messy especially when I flex again
Less than two hours later, but I fought it
Hiding down ducking strays from frustrated youths stuck in their ways
Someone get this Aryan a sheet
But if not for my financials
What you Mariah, fly through twice
But when all is said and done
Hey the prodigal son
You can try this at home
Cause I grab the mic and get DOWN, like Syndrome
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
Some shit about a message you left 
Squeeze it then squash it then pass it to a friend
The Twin Eagles ol' air his coup might as well ride by in the ambulance
Like I'm not, the one you wanna contest, see
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
That's why every time you mention a lyric
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow.
Homie, I'm the ScheiÃŸe, ask Doctor Dreizehn
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful
Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a Benzo
'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
I'm dying to breathe
I'm dying to breathe
I'm dying to breathe
I'm stumbling, I can't see straight
But I'mma still get dark on this shit.
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent

Missouri for Michigan didn't work
Fuck is that? Stop hammering (God)
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead"
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Be candy paintin' the neighborhood kids
My mom
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
I know what this looks like, officers
I know what this looks like, officers
I know what this looks like, officers
Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
Aunt Edna always told me "Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that"
You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
if they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come
if they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come
But it's like I payed the price of fame twice I hate it

It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
That I'm enchanting, with the romantic
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...)
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush,

Drugs really got a hold of me
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch I'm a droid
C'mon! Relax guy, I like gay men
'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Bumstickitty, bumstickitty, bum huh
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
'Cause I ain't playing around
But how do you keep up the pace
Everybody bores me,
You a slut but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,
Garbage bag for one of the windows
But if it don't, then ya'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and

Never fading, and I know that haters are forever waiting
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)

Two more exits, time is quite near
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
I feel like I'm morphing into something that's so incredible that I'm dwarfing all competitors.
How did you get so big?
and gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it
I'm wasting punchlines but I got so many to spare I just thought of another one that might go here
Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me
Need a backin' out this lady's Jag started blackin' out
Cause this is my space, you invade it
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches

Welcome to Mom and Dadâ€™s crazy world
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
The taste of your own medicine, here come a dose of it
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Consider the last four minutes as

Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Then we cuss each other, out,

The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
Paint be flyin' off my car
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
Word to Pacquiao, mama said there ain't nothing else to talk about
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon blew and
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Bin Laden on my ass

Told me she was going back into using again
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit
And just asked him to come crash
Nowhere to go but hysterical.
But you don't give a fuck
Annually knockin' the boots
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Of pills, think your boy is startin'
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
Checked in at the Royal Garden
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
but we'll see, cause we ain't lookin' for beef
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...
And hips and licked them lips and that was it

Where they pop toasters, and they live with their moms
The words that we meant that we didn't say
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
But I don't compete with nobody
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
Let's bounce tonight
Flashin' bread, roll down the window
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
Dirty Harry
No, Zack! Don't go back in there!
Used to smell the roses
We learn to let shit go, but then again
'Cause both of us are still involved, so
Too much pride between you and I
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
Why does everyone always leave me?
But suddenly, I feel my heart

Or you're the kind of girl that I can take a liking to
Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together
Guess I'm lucky,
Yeah, y'know! What's crackin Dre?
Only realized it was ironic
I only get naked when the baby sitter tells me She showed me a movie like "Nightmare on Elm Street"
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more

Did it even occur to you that I loved you?
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Show 'em why you're you
And some cum-wad from out the parking lot
At least sound, I sound like these clowns, like he sound
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
I can hear the music continue to crescendo
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black

If so to what extent
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!
It's different them last two albums didn't count
And they used to use my mother fuckin' trailer to tease me with
I need a new boyfriend." Hi. My name is JoJo.
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But the word "fucking" ain't meant to be a descriptive word
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
Guys, when someone you'd die for
When I rap I represent it and will never referee in it
Hi there, bitch...
You beef with me, I'mma even the score equally
You know what happens when I'm around, man
Hirin' strippers, prostitutes retirin'
But I take the same advice I had
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's 'foul' but my dicks on 'strike'
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are

Security's gone I'm trapped in the club
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed? 
I know this time Paul and Dre
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
My brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn
With his own private plane, his own pilot
You're frightened like "This guy might hurt me"
Pharmaceuticals, glue stick to crucify me at Bonnaroo
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, "Fuck the world!"
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Swish but don't spit it, swallow when I finish
when a thousand bullets come at your house
Kiss my butt. Lick the fumunda cheese from under my nuts
Baby, make us some French toast and show us some skin 
I'm just being honest, I can see the comments
Yes, babe, I'm fallin' in likeness kinda, why I love

Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
Outsiders, Pace One, Young Zee.

Neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' Marines

'Cause I was trying to leave No Doubt
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me

("Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?")
You are the ink to my paper
So bitch, shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Jessica Alba, put a breast on my mouth, bruh
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just the
He goes, "You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now"

Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
So I'm warning you, don't coax me
Step up to the target

Facin' the door, remainin' patient while stayin' complacent
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh-no he didn't!

But she swallowed my fucking leg whole like an egg roll
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old,
You wanna criticize, dog? Try a little mo'

Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
Fuck I'm gonna start letting off
In my own words I guess...
Sorry if I'm being graphic, but I'm stiff as a statue
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
You 'bout one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave,
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me
And your mental state's deteriorating slow
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
But see me on the street and duck
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Car crash, shows what they know
Truly yours the idiotic Bizarre
And make em come to your basement and listen
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat, Dre fall off that's news to meI never meant to give you mushrooms girl
You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
I'd rather hear 'em say "Die N-word" than Die Antwoord
'Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MCs
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I'm back (Slim Shady)
(I'm screamin' out no regrets) Can't do it, nah
He hit me I fell, I got back up all I did was book, now there's using your head
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
That butt won't ever give up
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
Who can say for sure?
that somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
Like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
Just let me rest my head in between that set of Ds
Be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
It's tragical, thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
Let's call your sister three-way
Very sexually active, very.
Michael, my knife go right hand
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 
She thinks I'm bein' mean and now
You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
His metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
One slug
I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
From boy to man, it's still make a whore moan like a thyroid gland
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
Another terrorist attacks
His name is (Marshall!)
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Hundred percent cut, no stitches required
But shit's about to hit the shingle
But shit's about to hit the shingle
But shit's about to hit the shingle
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
I love you babyAw man...
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's sweet
Fuck slugs I'm walkin gloves with a shotgun
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alrightHello
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
You all c'mon now
You all c'mon now
You all c'mon now
You all c'mon now
You all c'mon now
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin - throw up on the mic
The whole substance to my rap.
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?
Lindsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya
Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
With M-16's and ten clips each
Screaming, "Fuck the police!" like cop porn
They were sleeping, I made 'em stop snorin'
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a fucking year
(It makes them stay in a trance, No choice, they have to dance)
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan
i cant explain what it is my brain does
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
Shove a diamond up my hind end,
After they sip piss through Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Jealous of me, know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about
And this load is like the weight of the world
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Full magazine could take Staples out
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
I'll slap you off that bar stool
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress,
You gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
Proof's room slept on the floor of the motel then
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Until the day I started following your feetprints
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her.
But I won't back down
But I won't back down
But I won't back down
But I won't back down
I struggle with coming to my senses
The rap crown royals,
Got a whole generation of rappers coming up that are nutty with the flow
Guys, sucked eight/nine men
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
You're submitting to skill, sitting still
The press is about to go ape shit bananas on all the networks
And here's an autograph for your brother
I just bake cookies, Mr. Officer, looky, take a whiff of this
Little punk!
I know I'm a liar
I think a living never meant for me
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
I'm from Atlanta
Made 'em break out the popcorn
I'm having a stroke of genius, Elizabeth I'm coming to you, honey
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
You motherfuckas ain't smoking 
A lot of people ask me.. am I afraid of death..
And smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what your saying
Got no ring on this finger now
Dressed like a sailor, standing by a pale of garbage
I love you, Bean
But all bullshit aside I hit a stride
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
('Cause I wouldn't have been me)
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shit stain I thought
OK I'm done
I'm at a loss for words, uhh
My mother started screamin, "What are you on, drugs?!?
Hope so, now hoe...
It's almost 4 in the morning and you're in a
And ride it like a motorbike
Money'll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it
(then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin)
(then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin)
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

Then mosy on over to Rosie-o-Donnell's
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
I'm a pitbull off his leash
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Thutmose the Third, seven inch herringbones
What you think I'm kiddin' you?
Behind the boards sits Dre, legends are made this way
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)
Have some bullshit to readjust
And if a nigga's still out there you just gotta shoot, I carry over my street ethics to the booth
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
I couldn't see your ass gonna Heaven
But you gotta get your fire back
Turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Fuck it, let's all stand upYou claim if you get knocked by the cops
Just feels like we're a lot different.
Night club, shit, I was taught if your CD's on fire
And half of them ain't even funny like
There's so many other motherfuckers that just are
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
please don't cry for me, when i'm gone for good,
I harbor the art, of you nice wear
Lose your best friend from highschool, your wife too
Come hizzon, what kinda fuzukin' quizition is that?
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced
One day I plan to be a family man happily married
Hi, faggot
For weapon concealin'
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
With the ugly Kardashian
Or gets ya description an' sketches ya
Jose Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no
Ha plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boys, is all that I fetch
Throw up then gas, lungs collapse
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed
if you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought
'Til one day I grew suspicious, when I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
Don't try to deny it, baby, I'm the only one for you
Please tell me what happened with
Please tell me what happened with
Please tell me what happened with
And it don't stop oh
And it don't stop oh
And it don't stop oh
And it don't stop oh
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart, I sniff it
Try and awake
How they attacked the victim
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
Shit, fuck everything...
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh)
Looked around the room
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Just so that I don't explode
because he's so caught up in that snow white
After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Question is are you both so smart enough to feel stupid
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin' you look down
Fucking doctor, I didn't understand a damn what he said I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother.
Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with ya gal but
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, "Fuck it"
He's no longer getting them free
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neuman mad cerebral
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy
My image I have zero time or regard for
Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
Look them dead in the eye,
And a paychecks that were stuffed in a glove box
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
They all trying to get that stamp
You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so
Fuck the handle I fly off the hinge Let that boy off the bench, coach and throw it to him 
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And thereâ€™s nothinâ€™ else to say so I may aswell fly away
Lackin' with it, "he ain't spittin' like this on his last shit"
But I was put here not by accident
But you got a hard on for me. What you hollering my name for?
Now which one of you bitches down for the cause
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
To attack her character,
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
Shady Limited's in any size yo, Denim
I'm taking my life back)
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
I find it complicated just to hold a conversation
Get on down
I say everyday she be givin it up
Yeah, I'm open season
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass
I'm sorry weâ€™re alone
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's cube
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
there's somethin' about a white boy talking black and runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
This Brandy got my swinging
cum soon, and work that nigga, like a slave owner, when I dropped off my outfit, she knew I
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
Hi, how can I help you?
now I'm next, let's see who
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
A mic in my hand's a weapon (What?)
Propane takin' my cranium
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
When you want something bad enough to steal
You can already sense the climate is starting to shift
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
I got you caught up in the rapture
We'll start it out with caviar, Don Parigne
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records;
You 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
They said I was a gimmick, now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)
I did my best, I tried to change
And I'm sick of acting humble thats enough of that
I get the point. Fine. Me and Mommy are going."
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Translation, I will probably kill us both
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
dem better to ring the alarm boy,
Here's to the land that raised me
Here's to the land that raised me
Here's to the land that raised me
She's pro'ly six foot tall like bigfoot, the hell with that?
I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider
And leave you like that
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The principal walked in (What's going on in here?)
A couple of cocktails will send me to jail
You'll just make me stronger than I was
You'll just make me stronger than I was
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
And though you say the days are happy
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
I don't have any lines to go right here so, chubba teletubbie!
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissing people for no reason?
'Cause the way that I'm feeling tonight, everything I can just do right
And it's down right blasphemous
You get the new LL Cool J cooling system
In fact I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves
They cant sit, I donâ€™t think anybody understands it
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin about his millions
I just flip 'em the bird
I just flip 'em the bird
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
I look so sunburnt
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song learned who to aim it on
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
I walk up on ya, "Well, hello Tonya"
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Is you're the legs to my table
I'm like a fuckin wasp in the hospital lost
Every day
Dem know what's coming boy,
And you're a good person too
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
And I might snap, one day just like that
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells since yours ain't working out
Now look at all the pain I caused
Before I push this motherfucking button and blast off
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
Stop dwellin', then stop yellin'
You remind me of my mother
By a craze lunatic with a gun
Pull it, squeeze it, 'til it's empty
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson
I will sit on you
I will sit on you
You're snake-bitten with myâ€”venom
You sold your soul to me. Need I remind you?
Stingin the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls

("Damn!")
Ha ha! Woo!
You 'bout to experience euphoria
to see the look on ya fake mugs
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
Designed by a cartoon
Cause I'm always shittin when I'm rappin like master p (Unnnggggh!)
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the minis
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
The way we act
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
Girl, take this pole like a survey
A beautiful face is all that you have
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
everyone's making a stink about me
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And if I ever do live to be a legend
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot
I'm crying inside, I shout
I ain't placin' any blame,
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
You're witnessing a mass-occur like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Here we go now, doe-se-doe now, curtains up, the show must go
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
It's in their best interest to protect their investment.
The kinda crazy you can't fix
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I made
I heard a noise, where you goin'? What are you, bananas?!
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
Shit I laughed in his face spit
my uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
I'ma tell you the story
With a bottle full of malt liquor
Running around your backyard swimming pools
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
God, why did you take him?
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
Give out from underneath me
But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
Words in the way, I'm at loss by him
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo scented
Arsenic writer, author with arthritis
Iâ€™m coming to get that quarter back
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho
When you feel like you've had it up to here
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
You let my devil come out me
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Hell yeah!)
You got some views, but you're still below me
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Why be a king when you can be a God?Aw, yeah (It's like this, like this)
Misplacin' my anger enough to give Earl and Tyler, The Creator the brunt yeah
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
One of you tries to grab a knife
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
Simmer down
However I do show some respect to few
Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted
C'mon, yeah!!Ugh, you're a monster
another story, for surely, the pussy on toast after we toast, her clothes fell like bishop in
(Why are you doing this?)
When I take back what's mine, with pleasured hands
Im feeling won-der-ful,
Shit, if you only knew the half of it
My mother thought I was such a fun little boy
Like Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
I spilled like, like forty bottles
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
This is my dance song (Outsidaz)
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
(Slim Shady)
(Slim Shady)
(Slim Shady)
Taking My Ball and going home, hooome,
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
I make you think you're a backstabber
I make you think you're a backstabber
I make you think you're a backstabber
I make you think you're a backstabber
I make you think you're a backstabber
I make you think you're a backstabber
I make you think you're a backstabber
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
Yo, look at her bush. Does it got hair? (Uh huh!)
I choke mic's like asphyxiation when I'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin'
I've swallowed all I could
I'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
The death of Doody broke us in two
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And bust open like broken water mains
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
My name is Marsh and, my name is, my name is
That image burned in my brain
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
For the next four and a half minutes
Would've ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
I immediately run
So emotions enough to say "fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!" 
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
With every faggot you slaughtered
Straight jacket with a hundred eight brackets
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
I can spit in ya face while your standin' across from me, no apologies
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
Getting money anytime I want owning my own businesses and all that,
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion
Cause I hear the track and I'm starting to get fucking amped
Think about it before you walk in the door first
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
Girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
Why am I here, am I just wasting my time?
Fuck that! Do that shit! Shoot that bitch!
Have a party (turn the music up)
They get hated on in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop
And walk around with my pants hanging over my butt
Candy Rain-ass nigga, he got a deal, now he rappin'
The music you accuse me of tryna destroy
My computers will be seized and my keys to my ranch
It's my own insecurities!
My OCD's conking me in the head
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
Di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grÃ¢ce
My rap style's warped
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounce and grab a pair of stilts
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Yeah, it's been a ride
I ain't finished, bitch
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
Or still yet to be determined?
Find an escape
It's playing our song.
But what do I do? It's locked.
Strappin' with the audience as we perform hypersong
So Drake
Stick a fork in and turn
The passion and the flame is ignited
White America, little Eric looks just like this,
White America, little Eric looks just like this,
White America, little Eric looks just like this,
White America, little Eric looks just like this,
White America, little Eric looks just like this,
White America, little Eric looks just like this,
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
I leave you stymied, that's why they still vilify me like Bill O'Reilly
Take a little bit of this fluoride rinse
Such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
you where there when shit got thick
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake
That last "Relapse" CD was "ehh"
Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
when I shout
You're the cause of my pain and the medicine
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
Give me Donkey of the Day
Now I know you're feelin discouraged but homie just mark my words
Even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
A lot's happened in between them since I rised to this fame
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
Then we duke it out, then it dies down
It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of getting my hair pulled
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Every school I went
I've never seen no shit like this in my life before
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Come together let's all form and swarm just a little
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Depending on your mood, if it swings, think too many things
You wanna see fights I got a match for you
I ain't gone even ask
And said that Puma's The Brand 'cause the Klan makes Troops
Sales decline, the curtains drawn
This is the only thing that I'm good at
Without me knocking your block off
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
I donâ€™t see why these people always got my back
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
(their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
Now those days are over, scrapin' change in sofas
Like trying to start over
Got murdered in cold-blood
Yo! I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
but that's the last thing
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
Once upon a time where all we had
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
I am the bad guy, Kryptonite: The Green Chronic
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets
So bye for now
You're just small pokes little pricks
Yes siree, 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
But fuck the world 'cause they out to get us
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
Passionate ass-whooping and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
My point is this
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
You'll all get shot whether it's your fault or not, 'cause
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher
To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
Affable guy next door is laughable
Hello allow me to introduce myself
Iâ€™m on top of this thing so i may aswell fly away
Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few
And that's the only word I can think of right now
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
I'm buzzing, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Susan stop crying I don't hate ya
When it's time to walk away
I put both hands on your throat
God there's an exit comin' up, what the mother F-U-C-K's
And it's as though you feel you've died
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
And we're both adults, so there's no excuse
Let us beg to differ
As a goodbye note, 'cause your dad's at the end of his rope
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
Yeah, move it or lose it freak, move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably
Damn, I'm (Yeah) getting too fuckin' old for this (Yeah)
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
All my life I was very deprived
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!
This always happens
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
Or you might end up found dead by the lake
And they cheated, they lie like Amerigo
Dazed and I'm so confused
But I won't be made a fool of,
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
Thinkin' if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him
But I ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
My hands have been cuffed
Quit worrying about what they do and do shady
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam.
I just wanna be famous,
I just wanna be famous,
I just wanna be famous,
I'm bad enough to commit suicide
Proof spit his verse,
Fuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
The minute we spot ya, the semi'll pop, nigga, we got ya
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
I'm a keep eating 'till Richard Simmons comes to my house
Fuck you, die you son of a bitch
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
'Cause I'm stronger than I was
'Cause I'm stronger than I was
I'm drunk. So, Satan, take the fucking wheel
And that very well may be the same reason they don't say me
And awake with a headache
You were shittin on us too
Alright, aight, aight, aight, aight, aight
Leave these pussies stretched out like the Octomom
They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head
'Cause right now I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
Good God, dip, do a little slide
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at this
Honey I applaud that ass
Thats in the back of my mind,
Blow them up if they ain't want me
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
You wear your heart on your sleeve. I sport that white tank boy.
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
I just want to be just like you
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
What's occurring before, after and during the show
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
Five dozen, flies buzzin' over your head
And so I'm saying,
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
Run your motherfuckin pockets, ASAP
Live half my life and throw the rest away
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
Word, Rick, word, man, you heard, but don't get discouraged, girl
For I am Triumph, the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold
While I'm holding a pistol with this many calibres here?? (here??)
I just bodied the beat, so that hoe must've been dug
Only good for cooking, cleaning
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough so
when running with the long arm of the law I'm long gone
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta, a stupid piece a
The cops in my Nana crib, but I'm not there
I'm in the Slick Rick eye patch, but I got it from Hex
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot
On these bogus pochers,
Then we say, "Fuck it", cry our eyes out
You're ass backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
I just can't get past these little pissants
But I sure as hell got it backwards cause y'all could get jumped
Make â€˜em swarm, make â€˜em fight over the shirts Iâ€™ve worn
Cause this shit is getting embarrassing, the fog is thick and the air is thin
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
'Cause I'm in Hell
'Cause I'm in Hell
'Cause I'm in Hell
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Oh, God, my brain is racing
Now we are trapped on the throne
Now we are trapped on the throne
Now we are trapped on the throne
You tryna snort on my keys?
Iâ€™m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
"I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?!?"
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
Return of the no good
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
Found down unresponsive
My will I'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
Time to get rid of these rap criminals
that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Be ready to come off the top as sharp position
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
I diarrhea on track so it needs plunging
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealing
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
He may seem as though he's plain normal
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk) shake your body
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outtie
I don't know it's just the way I am
I think I love you too
I think I love you too
I think I love you too
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
Some are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Some are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
And fuck was the first word I ever learned
Trapped in his own drawings
So this would be the part of the song
So this would be the part of the song
"Trunk Muzik, Yelawolf's better", fuckin' bitch
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
I'm the American dream! I'm the definition of white trash balling,
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party!
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party!
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party!
Wonder would they even call? When the music stops
If he gang bangin' or not
You can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it
and I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
Flows tighter, hot headed as Ghost Rider
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
To the whacko 'fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
For the god in the flesh, the ominous Indominus Rex
Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
Givin you shit bitch - don't even bother askin me (Get away from me!)
Through your living room window
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
Mr. Don't-Give-A-Fuck still won't leave
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Not over 'till we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
Yo, I put that shit on a greatest hits album
And take away their freedom like you did to me
I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
It's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
it takes nutz
Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nike's
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
OK, hello it's the Martian
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones
If you agree to repeat after me, I Love You (I love you baby)
"Whoops!"
So get your gun and if you comin
so goodbye, goodbye Hollywood,
"This is for every time you took my orange juice,
Don't worry, man those bullets will still be at your ass firin'
Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights yeah
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Remember me? ("Slam! Slam!")
Naw man, haha
I said get up!
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Days that I don't know who
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free

The last Mathers LP done went diamond
But Suge has Irv's on a string
Homosexual dissector
God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
Probably end up baggin' the cocktail waitress
and I consider myself one of those
and I consider myself one of those
and I consider myself one of those
I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
So kids say no to drugs (say no)
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Yes suh', ya texta' is bitch...
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Woke up shortly thereafter, hungover
Yeah maybe that explains
And all we do is shove each other,
Bitch it's you I tore out the frame, I win
You are the prime target
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
Use the tools you're given!
That I won't be making a mistake
Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speaking mine or Timbaland's name
Maybe that's what drew us
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep.
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep.

Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out"
Lyrical rascal, kick back the Tabasco
Or Godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on
Who's that in the cool blue back
I got a hunch like your back when it's arching
And it sounds like I forget I'm a father and I push it farther, so, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
Off a plank and
'Cause one minute I'm hollerin', "Screw you"
Oh oh oh oh oh

B.I.G. 2000 Born Again.. c'mon..
They said I can't rap about being broke no more
We perish in the blast,
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
Matter of fact it was just the other night
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
It's the path I've chosen to go
I'm done being your punching bag
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
Gotta love it, cause I expose the facade
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
I'm gonna fackin' cum

Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Wrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Lost in a ball of confusion
How should I begin it and where does it all end
How should I begin it and where does it all end
How should I begin it and where does it all end
How should I begin it and where does it all end
How should I begin it and where does it all end
How should I begin it and where does it all end
Inside the depths of his basement
but take a look at my
but take a look at my
but take a look at my
but take a look at my
but take a look at my
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
So yeah dad let's walk
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where
She's on my Johnson.
Now you're slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
Time to separate the sheep from goats (yeah)
They say I never knew which way I was goin
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancing
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
Look at me work wizardry with these words
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
Lose your tooth and nails
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out.
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador of the valentines day massacre slash assassin
You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
But now it's, lay me down to sleeping
What?
For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece 
Grow up? Nah
That got me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
under my Long Johns
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
One shot two shot three shots four shots
One shot two shot three shots four shots
One shot two shot three shots four shots
One shot two shot three shots four shots
One shot two shot three shots four shots
And just make him say what he wants him to say
I'll shit on anybody
Don't wanna be without you
I've been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
Directly aimin' a gat at my head
Into a motherfucking crime scene?
I never had any of this shit planned, mom, please believe
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
And it backfires in your face hard
Please do not remove me from this movie theater please
I'm running...
I'm running...
I'm running...
and no one lied to
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
As the title of the album suggests
Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
I want you to understand something
Like the gas in the tank, she gettin' low on me
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr."
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
Bring the shaun dawn, burn marajaun, do what you want
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent J
I'm the ringing in your ears
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, i'm trapped
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
To stay so stable
Everyday's just a holiday
Homie, I know I'm never gonna be the same without you
End up running back into them all
End up running back into them all
End up running back into them all
Submerged like a submarine
Contemplating my next plot again
I can make her spin around
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Bobby Creek
I know you want me girl
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Nah, ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touchÃ© me
This is crazy, the way we act when we confuse hip-hop
(I'm screamin' out no regrets)
Clinically insane, brain is on Venus suck Uranus
Inside your world
I hang with a bunch of hippies
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
they took away my right to bear arms
Telling me to be positive
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Making an excuse for us to act it out
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
on your chest
Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
In the faces of in this democracy of hypocrisy
My dreams come to fruition
Motherfuckin', difficult yeah, 'til then hopefully ya
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
All day, all day, all night
All day, all day, all night
All day, all day, all night
Big bags of the grass, Zig-Zags, I'm with the Doc, so
My flow (My flow), still a psycho (Psycho), killer (Killer)
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
For turning your fucking back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?
I think it went wandering off down yonder
I come home and clean up your mess
Sometimes I feel like
Sometimes I feel like
Sometimes I feel like
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
You can have corn rows inside your hair
Stay wide awake
Stay wide awake
Stay wide awake
I meant in half, oil the blades
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because...
Stoop to someone's level (Yeah)
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics?
And when they drop me, I'm randomly sockin' fans
Lets get into it You smoking with the triest and truest 
I love pissin' you off
Location of the woods
Fuck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
so there'll be more for me (Hippie! God damnit!)
Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
Two years, but you left on the first of May
Fanny packs, hourglasses
and sells a couple of million records
Thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
And everyone who has doubt, remind
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
when i come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
I'm tired of committing so many sins
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncy ball
Who the fuck passed you the mic and then said that you can flow?
Make your mama be like "Ohh! This is good! Who sing this?"
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?
I told em, "Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth? Girl, your mans is like in the booth
All them foster homes.",
(kill kill kill)
(kill kill kill)
If only I wasn't travelling down this road by my lonely
You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
But like a wedding band
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty
We're outtie, five thousand
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
Heh, the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said "Hey Bitch..
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
And make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
Why do they try to fight today?
So who's bringin the guns in this country? (Hmm?)
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Band just making my neck itch
Fuck that shit, bitch
Shady
I ain't waste nine bullets on you for you to not sing no hooks
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
Switch it up, and watch them haters not give it up 'cause they're just not good enough.
Everything was happenin' so fast. It was like I blinked, sold 3 million
Kool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
Backpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
Christo-pher Reeves swimmin in my swim trunks
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name
Get it? Calm Batman.
Panic mode 'bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
Every parasite needs a host (haha)
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
It comes to them trailers in them South Parks
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
And break your fucking legs
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
'Cause every time I go to try to leave
'Cause every time I go to try to leave
'Cause every time I go to try to leave
'Cause every time I go to try to leave
I gave you enough time.
'Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
You throw me out the house,
She's pro'ly gonna kill ya; still wanna check, see?
In the end I'm gone
(C'mon, I'll Shit On You!)
Hide 'em in the wall, well how long will the drywall take?
Revenge is the best medicine
I told you I can't sing
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
I'll twist you into a different shape
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uh!)
You know this ain't love, you know this ain't love
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
(Who's your daddy?) I don't give a fuck, but I wonder
But something pulls 'em closed again
Cause one day it could cost you your name
Fucking fictitional characters and fariytales,
The coroner with a storage bin rented
I got a couple of mansions
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
I get too blunted off of funny home grown, â€˜cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono (oh no!)
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I just couldn't quit
{i'm goin' back home}...Tell myself that I was doing alright
As I got a little bit older, my hate
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,
I am
I am
I am
I am
Then I wonder why I stay famous
but why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other emcees?
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Then why the fuck am I yelling at air
Voices are leading me up to the attic. I love my house.
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Shit, it's no wonder
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
Nigga you front you gon' get it, OK now maybe I said it
I wanna save you girl
I wanna save you girl
I wanna save you girl
I'm comin', you're goin
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I
I said "Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things"
And a Rottweiler too, I'm not in the mood so
To the La-Z-Boy sofa
'Cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo.
But there afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair
Come here baby, bring daddy his Oscar
I park the car in the garage and go in and
Skip over the "huggy bear" and all the "kissy face", please
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
Eminem is heading skyward
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
For a gangster you sure did shit your pants
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
It just means so much more to so much more
It's too late to start over
It's too late to start over
Now here I come screaming "Attack!"
Tired of not having a deal
If you could count the skeletons in my closet Under my bed and up under my faucet
If you could count the skeletons in my closet Under my bed and up under my faucet
If you could count the skeletons in my closet Under my bed and up under my faucet
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
"Daddy, look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
I'm makin' up words, so you can understandable
Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always
And it's just
Superman ain't savin' shit
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate's shower scene
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew
Dad
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah
Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon
I'mma break that birdie's neck
Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, "Protect your neck"
(AH!) Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope?
I'm 'bout toâ€”
Remember me? ("I just don't give a fuck!")
But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
I treat the mic like the block, fought with my rocks an squeeze critics who expect me to under achieve
I cut my toes off and step on the receipt before I foot the bill
And in this corner, we have the mister
because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
Sometimes, you gotta come back down (It's all going to hell now, man)
Hollow tips is the lead, the .45 threw
Haters started to appreciate my art
I've come to release this info
Michael Jackson â€“ who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
no choice I chase cream so..
Bitch, come here!
You're acting foolish, this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in love with me John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
I'm so sorry! Susan please wake up!
dont ever make the first move
dont ever make the first move
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
I'm Optimus, I make prime examples of mini-Tonkas
I guess a modern-day Jack The Ripper is all that I am.
Look at him hauling ass I think he left his wife
Hypnotic, product I got the antibiotic
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
But I can't even change the station
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (People)
I know you want me girl, in fact I see ya grin
With first aid tape and raped on the first date
I go berserker than a fed-up post-office worker
(With what? Their car?)
It's just us, nobody else!
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither
So I can whip your fucking ass
Almost in a coma. Yeah, homie, come on dole 'em out.
Mysteriously disappear into thin air
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
{Screamin' out no regrets, yeah, no apologies, I ain't takin' shit back}
****** I did it from a mind of a mental patient
And I feel so isolated, nice I made it
Manslaughter goons under the moonlight
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me.
Keep makin' new shit
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
I don't do Jordans and Audemars
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters
Butt squeezin' it's the season
On my last rock, for my slingshot
But now those days are over
When we arrive we probably won't leave
When we arrive we probably won't leave
When we arrive we probably won't leave
The more time goes by, the more life happens
"Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"
Well, just know that I'm alright
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah I'm rich as a bitch
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
Yeah kick on back
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
"But I'm here to rebuild you."
Hands up, officer don't shoot
Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em
Good day and good night, Ortiz yo where the fuck you at?
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
Aftermath, still running hip-hop amazing
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Stood up and started to see stars
You're at the laboratory, storming
Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
I wanna get away from this place I do.
I wanna get away from this place I do.
I wanna get away from this place I do.
It'd be so empty without me
I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's neck like a Pixy Stix.
Trials and Tribulations
Everybody come on an
Everybody come on an
Bitch, I ball like a baby
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain baby
All I want is for us not to hurt
Get the fuck out of here
now here they come as we expected now we just set em' up
now here they come as we expected now we just set em' up
Cause it just died like "ooh, food coloring, duh"
Rollin' with at least three choppers, Ryan is that
While I shred MC's, like cheddar cheese
A game in this game, crush a motherfuckers free start,
C'mon! How fucked up is you?
The way she's grinding that pole
I could've been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
I break free like Chesimard
All I am simply is just an MC
The Dre to my Eminem
Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
It was never meant it was just an accident
You'll be coming out of Mommy's stomach soon
He swatted me with it, I'm cryin'
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
No regret, live by a cold June, no bot, y'all niggas won't be satisfied 'till I show ??, go out on the
Pussy, go pick your pussy leaves off your cunt tree, fuck you
To tarnish, whatever the legacy, love or respect
I'm off my fucking meds but I'm on an electric scooter
I just want you to be normal
I just want you to be normal
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
Gave these molecules to
1, 2, 3 (check, check) 1, 2, 3 (check, check) 1, 2, 3,
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
Don't get dragged to the auction
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause we need a little controversy
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
An erratic train of thought
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone, uh huh
I'm rapping I don't care what none of ya'll say, 
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
Never been served if memory serves
I need one 
Why you hitching at night?
Music into the picture and it became my new religion
And on a quiet night
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
Let me be the voice and your strength, and your choice
Puting it but I like staying
I hate the swings but I love being an underdog
Just smile back...
Just smile back...
Just smile back...
Now I never wanted someone to die so bad in my fuckin' life
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
Lie down fucker (baa), try countin' sheep
I'mma pull you to this bullet, and put it through you
NO
I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
What up Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (Facts)
Fix your musk, you'll just be another one bit the dust
that I had a baby sister
Same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding
All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
And created a sink hole, buried the stink hoe in it, then paid to have the street repaved (the fuck?)
We are not alike, there's not alike us
We are not alike, there's not alike us
to say what I like, and walk around flippin the bird
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole, better pack toilet paper
Let your hair down to the track
I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
This ain't a song it's a warning to Brooke, Hogan and David Cook
We as Samaritans
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback.
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
"Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black?"
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.
Now listen to me, while you're kissing her cheek
I told the woke me to go to sleep
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch.
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
I don't wanna go another round (but I won't)
I don't wanna go another round (but I won't)
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Your soul's mine.
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit."
You think I'm ugly, don't you?
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know help me! What the fuck's happening, I think I'm fucking melting
I'll bet you do
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
I just finished fuckin' a fish called Wanda
So bring the money by tonight - cause your wife 
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow, hand's on my head, touched knees to elbow
It become a problem. You're too pussy to tackle, get up.
It's they who legs I brake and make achy
An as a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me, that same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
It's a must I redeem my name 'n' haters get mushed.
"Daddy, it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding."
How I'm buryin' these artists
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'
'Cause it's too easy to see
'Cause it's too easy to see
'Cause it's too easy to see
'Cause it's too easy to see
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)

There's thunder.
'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
I'm tired of all you (of all you)...
I blow eighty holes in you
Who said he was better,
Like mic check, pimp for what it's worth I got the right knit, sittin' here excited by some shit that
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
We're on that ninth cloud, two insane lovebirds
Just for no reason other than the just to tease him
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you
Arrived back at my enemies' crib with Hennessy
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you
I got a million in cash
Collapse and crumble perhaps
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
Then...
"You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?
Your pussy lyric,
but however it works its insane
You don't think so, do you?
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone

Slim Shady, 2001
Slap hips, support domestic violence

For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my arse whipped
I'm a grown man!
My next whore's gonna have mechanical arms
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Catch fire, get upset and fire back
MC's you better consider this a formal warning
No one, no one is iller than me
No one, no one is iller than me
No one, no one is iller than me
No one, no one is iller than me
And I think my neck is breaking.
Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat
Quit crying, bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?
When it whirls, when it twirls
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out

And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
Girl you think that other prick's hot
So never say never cuz Shady Aftermath together
problems among young people today, is fungus
Rather have me (I know, but), we just in too deep
Rather have me (I know, but), we just in too deep

But you know you aint gonna do nuttin
Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
You're my Xanax and my valium, I'm an addict, you're a downer
Never took much to convince Dre

The Eminem Show was fantastic
Mentally endangered; I can't stay away from a razor
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
You're tied up in the basement while I chill on your sofa
The sorcerer of intercourse - if it's forced, it's him 
But I think I got just the thing
Bottoms up on the pill bottle
But whatever this is, it's working
Formula 40-40 and 40s with bad capsules
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
I need to stop bein' debated
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt.
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
I pretend to work there, while I clean the floor
I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
What you usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?
That's all that matters for the time being
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party!
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party!
Call 'em toy soldiers (Yeah)
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' those pins in us
SLOW UP!
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
My baby mama's not dead (uh-uhh) she's still alive and bitchin (yup)
I would
I can keep getting my ass kicked, keep it coming back
We just met and I just fucked you
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
I get to meet famous people look at her, dag
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
I think I got a generation brainwashed
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the don, I'm King Kong
Any opinions or somethin you just wanna get off your chest
Hi, my name is...
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
Me? Tear no shed
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery

Nor did he come to do the same,
Wait, run it back, I said give you an L, inhale
I'm here to rescue you
I'm here to rescue you
I'm here to rescue you
To the pain, the stress, the drama
Waitin' to choke
You need to stop drop and roll 'cause when you say the shit to give the whole Hip-Hop Shop to blow
But I think I might be buildin' up a tolerance to you
There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
So patient, see, I try to be but gee, why does she taunt me?
If you're still looking for smoke, I already gave you an L
When you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10
Turn around and use it on me
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin around crippled
Now the sky's nothing but black
And said "Oh it's like that?"
But I'm sorry, Kim
I'm blew out from this blunt (sighs) fuckI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
Ga-Uh and then the come to find out it was Justin
Yeah, which brings me back to the real dad that I zero had
It's all about a man planning what his future is
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Take a swing at the deacon
'Cause we both are getting sloppy
Slim Shaâ€” mind's in the gutter, but insane
- the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses"
But oh it's so fuckin' wet and soft
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
The mortician of love sent from above.
I'm the miracle whip, a trickster
I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies and Proof
Obviously, I'm not gettin' through
And if you wanna run your mouth
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Them fuckers got you on tape
Dick is a bargain or two, now I'm gettin' blue like Kolonopins
Not able to stand to save you
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs
So then what does it got you thinkin'
So suck my motherfuckin dickOkay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed,
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
You can't cut the mustard, What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
King Tee, UTFO and Schoolly D, PE and BDP
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
Strongest suit, but you can get my

I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
A father
And takin' her straight back to the Motel-8
"I'm a heartless monster"
"I'm a heartless monster"
I'll run a truck through the weed house
She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice
YZ and Chi-Ali, Rakim and Eric B., they were like my therapy
No man would boldly go to this place
(Is you hit?)
Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
I recommend you take your things and check them in
'Cause it's theâ€¦
I'm unstoppable
Wake up behind these trenches,
Wake up behind these trenches,
Wake up behind these trenches,
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
You make me sick
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
I've got so much more to do
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
What you tryin' to be? My new wife?
No one could do it better
Always itchin' for something to do, was flipping
Often as I can and skim through all them bitches
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
It's the kinda nightmare you dream about
Dre, just let it run
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow,
Honest and open talk to you
My candy paint's enough
He's taping me, he's biting me, he's laughing like it's funny"
It goes by the name of Eminem
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side.
That I'm a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his mama,
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
She asked could I give her mine two
(Hip hop is the devil's music) Is that me? It belongs to me?
And you spit and people are feeling your shit.
You can hurt 'em
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a biggie and 'pac joke
And I hope your butt is hurt
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
That was never my object for someone to get killed
It's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve.
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin me and I couldn't breathe
The minute shit was heated she just bailed
And since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take 3 naps
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
I'm hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire,
(Rah Digga, Pacewon, Young Zee)
Turn their back on you, dawg
Bitches lust. Man, they love me when I lay in the cut.
Now everywhere I go they scream out go, I'm bout to clean house, yo
Fuck him in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching
Why can't you be normal? (Yeah)
One without a cause (clean slate)
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still coppin' a feel
And have the lady at the desk bring
As she went for my midsection
Yeah, uh oh, better beware knuckle heads
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
Strap on, other words if you're gonna
And if you get it then you just might not know
And if you get it then you just might not know
And if you get it then you just might not know
And if you get it then you just might not know
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Why are you being so mean?
if you think your the top and king of the castle
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
And there's a million of us just like me
so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
So many things different (things different)
Like I just left the damn concession stand (Yeah)
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
Got you feelin' me, whether willing or unwillingly
A kid who refused to respect adults
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
Dadâ€™s a little nervous, but at the same time excited
Cuz we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Oh but it feels so fucking good
I'm right in your ass (sodomy)
Overd-d-dose
Overd-d-dose
Overd-d-dose
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin some trees (HEY!)
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
Back better than ever,
So, I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurring
I'm so raw I still need to un-thaw
What do I gotta do to get through to you, to show you
But wear diapers cause you might leave a streak
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
Gotta roll me the ladder.
Then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)
To make a bad girl good
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
And not say what I got to say
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
wearing buku vests
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes,
Give me contact buzz 
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
Razor blades with me to make you bleed,
There's a concept that works
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Who stand inside of the booth truth spilling
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me

Where there's flames, there's chronic
And I'll be in the back of your memory
Why you always need a lecture?
but I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
What's gotten into me?
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
And your childhood too
I'd never love you enough to trust you
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
In search of a chick who stacked them so thick
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)Eminem Has a full line of chainsaws
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again
This must be how bein' hoodrich feels

Leanin' out the window, going Keyser SÃ¶ze
C'mon

If I ran who would I run to,
Spend a million a track and went over my budget (Ohh shit!)
On leaving this world this evening,
When shit is in the stores, cause you can be a star
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number
You're not dead! You're not dead!
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
But I'm not giving up 'til I get my respect, and I won't stop 'til I get enough,
Shady what are you doing chewing on a human,
Told you I'm so dirty, homie you can throw me in some holy water
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her?
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name is... "
Your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed
or was it a figment of
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Count down to Nuclear Meltdown
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
It gets no better than this
In the sun cause I donâ€™t tan, I burn, blood clot
Illiterate, illigitimate shit spitter
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Oye, yoy-yoy
America, and here's to where it all
No brake pads, no such thing as last
I don't know, it's just the way I am
All the hate, can't tell exactly where it stems from
Come on! Let's go! We're gonna make a porn!
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
That's why I ain't got no time, for these games and stupid tricks, or these bitches on my dick,
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
That's how much we have in common
That's how much we have in common
That's how much we have in common
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know (cause they know)
Iâ€™ve been a career asshole
But it shouldn't be difficult to explain
He just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what I'm saying?
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
Take your Nintendo and then skate
Bitch I'mma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
And as we go along
Starting to think we were made for each other
Spiraling, here I go, I`m outta control like no
For a fucking reason for it that ain't there
Keep the motor on then I'm leaving (I'll Shit On You!)
(I don't want it)
My shit donâ€™t stink, I dont think so
As I wait to be scooped up in that van
Prove that if you were half as nice
She said, "The fuck with that, where's my Louisville Slugger at?"
Blow up and be in a position
Out the trash can and zoom
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
Or you think water is pink
Though I'll probably be jumpin' across the stage
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
Now stomp your fuckin' feet 'til you get to squishing a hoe
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
It's lust, it's torturous
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
I spit out a line and rhymed "birthday" with "first place"
Like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
when motherfuckers hate your guts
Fuck shooting, I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases
Little engine gone, little engineYeah, yeah, I get it
Cut off his oxygen Slim snot gourgin
Paris Hilton home made pornos
Like California wishin' rain to pour
And I creep right through the front, see
You know, technically, I'm not even really supposed to be here right now,
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
I do explosions and Molotovs
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)...
Like something's about to happen
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
And after all is said and done
everything blow up and all you did was just grow
Hangin in the club, with my nephew Eminem
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Fuck that shit, cut the sack
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
Then combine 'em with Method Man and Redman
An tell him suck my dick, take a bow an leave with a sack full of amar cheese, I found it hard to believe
And I saw your headlights as I looked back
I screamed, "Owww! My appendix feels like they could burst!
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
And if you fall, I'll get you there
Examination of more car tunes than animation
(Where's Bizarre at?)
He ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time
I'm drawn in so I guess I'm a mess
Shi-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-it
Stop, don't, I don't mean don't stop
How could you let him sleep in our bed?
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie, when life's a drag
Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
Keep speaking my name, name, name
Keep speaking my name, name, name
Keep speaking my name, name, name
Keep speaking my name, name, name

I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?
Drugs, you became a lot softer"
Oh dang I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag!
And then pull up at 5AM in the drive in a stretched white limo
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
You'll give 'em not even a statement
I don't see nobody else (I guess I keep talking to myself)
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I lose my mind and my temper
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?
Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped you
E.T.A. 10 minutes
It's arrivederci
To pull his dick from the dirt, and fuck the whole universe
Yeah buddy
To the light at the end of the tunnel
To the light at the end of the tunnel
To the light at the end of the tunnel
Yes he can, I just did faggot, now guess again
My vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin
I'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in The Source
I'mma be a fucking rapist in a Jason mask
That's when he popped up a number one
Used to put 50 on the layaway, now my closet 50 shades of grey
Came back like a boomerang on 'em
Testing one, two, um... twelve

But she's the reason why I am high what I'm high on
I'm blazing MCs, at the same time amazing MCs
In this corner: weighing 175 pounds,
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
I so started to rock fellow
What a wonderful day; I should go outside and play
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
His house is a broken home, there's no control, he just let's his emotions go...
My competition can't see me
Kick down Dakota Fannings front door while the whore is tanning
I have no life outside of that
Smokes a bag of his weed
And save me from myself and all this conflict
It's like they murdered your ass
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Smart aleck, goddammit
Now the strays flying all over the place
And I got an evil twin, so who the fuck do you think that 3rd and that 4th spot's for?
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
Eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting
I'd rather die than you not by my side

Now hold this (Oh), oh shit (Oh)
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads (Fuck you!)
I'm back on my fuck hoe's, with a whole new hatred for blondes
But I know at least he's heard it
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
Feels like I been down this road before.
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
You can't run from me, Kim
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
You drive me bonkers, Iâ€™m about to get my swerve on for sure
Fuck that shit
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
Living in this world without youTell me where to go, tell me what to do
You're found dead in your garage, with ten o'clock news coverage
Ed O.G. and EPMD, D.O.C., Ice-T, Evil Dee
To show you how much I adored you
But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
If at any should I go
What are friends?
To make a cast, beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
She stomped him, just 'cause he asked to put his hands
Ah Your finger just went in my ass
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thingWarning, this shit's gon be rated R, restricted
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school

To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby

Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
You're just like a little windbox
My dick is sore from fuckin', when I bust there's nothin' left
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split
Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
I'm fed up with being humble
And take a vacation to trip a broad
In Gotham when I'm gone
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
'Cause here we go, he's Jigga durra Jigga da chk Jigga
Without him, I don't know where I'd be

And colliding with an 80-year old lady with groceries
Shady's right back on your bitch ass

From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
Nasty Nas wants to square dance with me
Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church
They call me Kanye crazy (Yah)
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me
I said I'm sorry mama!

I said I'm sorry mama!
But you confirmed my low end theory though, should've known when I made it all the way to third base
She's got her jaw stuck, from sucking my dick. Aww, fuck.
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
-- Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
I might relapse, get on some bullshit
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Bitch bring it, these niggas that I hang with

All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
Really does is make our love
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I'm going to try to find some more
It's making me crazy what's in my?
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
The era that I'm from will pummel you
Who can't think of shit
He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan
what i tell you
She on the orange pill
Driving around with a smashed front end
'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I think I swallowed a loofah
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Laughter, pain, it's insane,
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
Shady for us competition  Faggot, There ain't none 
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
With half of her head shaved
Drop the bomb on em
I'ma love it.. (hahaha)
I'm still shockin' like droppin' a boombox in bathwater
Relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
I take seven (kids) from (Columbine)
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Just letting you know that you're not alone
He said "What if you went platinum?" I'd just laugh at him
He said "What if you went platinum?" I'd just laugh at him

Or a damn.. or a fuck.. or a shit
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with
Picture me for a second and imagine it
When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
Man, go ahead, what you waitin' for?
Ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that,
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
It goes one for the money, two for the show
Probably should've never let me call that job of yours
And starts imagining things
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
I got a "Yukmouth" and it's polluted
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah)
We all fall down...
If it was anyone's house G Rap and Rakim would be havin' you mop floors
Now picture us. it's ridiculous you curse at the thought
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil

You never hear me say, "Forgive me"
Or is it a circle jerk or wait a minute
Daddy, is Ja Rule taller than me?
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of Pac influence
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
No bitch (Oh), you don't know shit (No)
For some adversaries, I carry big guns
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
What am I saying, allow me to run it back and rewind it
And you've had enough of me
"E" and hop out the vehicle and knock on your do'
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
i'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
Especially after the methadone
Big L had just got popped just a month before
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!

Spit a rhyme to freeze the clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em.
Who knows how it's gonna play out?
Daybed, iPod
Daybed, iPod
Ooh boy just touch my body
Chuckled and laughed, buttaled my last rebuttal
How you expect her to act in the sack when she's closing her eyes, fantasizing of digging her nails in my back to this track.
I can only take so much of you all at one time
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)

Finna take you out like an outro
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up! (Yeah!)
You may call it a pass I call it hauling my ass
Nobody can tell me shit cause I'm a (big rockstar)
Nobody can tell me shit cause I'm a (big rockstar)
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
Don't look for trouble but I serve you gourmet
Who just act like little girls
Ivanka, stiff arm her
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
It's not up to me,
It's not up to me,
And let you live
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas 
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?
The way you acting slice when I tear your back with knifes
Remember me? ("I have no remorse")
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
I've just vanished without a trace
(Evil rise)
I gave my vest to
Yeah, I'm a criminal
All I do is rap
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed
in my house
Proof had a proposition
And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
I'm snatchin every penny - it gotta be that way nigga, face it
Well you're too two-faced for me thought you was my number one true blue ace
Man first of all I'm a boss
Now I'm in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery, ah
Your last releases, you bad diseases, that's the reason
And implants are so big
And that's the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the "Oh Foolish Pride" girl
Suckin on the tits! Had the hooker beggin for the dick
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
Let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days.
Where's the thrill in the hunt?
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
Shawn Don
Alright Stop!.....Pajama time
We might wind it up, unbound like we're trying for the Cy Young
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Knowing still got a few chunks on your shoestring
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure

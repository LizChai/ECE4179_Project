Now what bothers me the most
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' t-to
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
There's darkness closing in (evil twin)
One day for every pill
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
These are the things that we must go through
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
To find babbling Max, gaffling tracks
Terror to the business, married to the strippers, T-Pain
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend?
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
Baby, please come back
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt
While everybody is watching in the party applauding it
Why did we have to break up? All I asked for was a glass of punch
Yeah I got something I want to share.
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
Nobody asked for life to deal us
Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
While juggling waffles baking
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
To avert a disaster
I'm not your husband (Nah), you ain't my girlfriend
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
Change the station I hate this song!
Boy hit the beat & just treat that shit like it's a diary
When you retards can roll the dice
On "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP
'Cause you can get it like over the counter (Yo)
I've been sipping on like, vodka (Head's numb)
I've been sipping on like, vodka (Head's numb)
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie
You really did a number on me
As intense as I do and the irony
(He can't say whore)
Assume the position and get back down on your knees - c'mon
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have,
You can even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
That another nigga got you? They didn't see skills
OK then! Everybody, listen up!
Like nut on your spine
the whole city of Detroit
Yeah, uh
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
Flipped out, ripped down the drapes
THEY BEEF 'N WE LEAVING 'EM COKED UP!!!
Rap God spit lyrical bullets (pew!)
And I knew it but Proof isn't here to see me through it
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
OK
So read up, about how I used to get beat up
They say I'm a spoiled little baby
The day he gave me that shot when I was just 'bout to quit
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Drinkin', cussin', and hyper smilin'
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
How can I moonlight on the side?
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
Shit's finna get thick again
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Weezy keep ya head up,
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently
It's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept
Inappropriate? So be it, I don't see it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
Shake-speare, so what if insults are revoltin'
But kissed them old days, adios, I did it
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
Now that was awesome
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Glad bags, yeah glad to be back, 'cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dead in rehab
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on boo
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked
You wanna butt heads? Shut up, Beavis, ha ha
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, "The Vapors"
Take a day off or what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel
Something I won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions, so it's over
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough
The only way to see me is if you lookinâ€™ up from down below
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough
It'd be Jennifer Lopez - and Puffy, you know this
So at night before I sleep I look in the mirror
plot is thickenin' worse, cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a
Oh well, this is my life so
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
You want what you can't have
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother,
Got nothin' to do with me
Got nothin' to do with me
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm kinda in the zone
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
"Ding-dong," the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
I'm cold buzzin', I never been low budget
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians
Gag-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ag
But that isn't scaring us.
When you gonna learn how much money weâ€™ve earned
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I can see that he's just a punk 
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
In that video she sings, "Get out, you bozo.
Ha ha
She said, "No, your music"
You'll get the hint, ho: I'm in your window
Or should I sound cranky and bitter
her, you never would expect that blow, Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low,
It's unfortunate but it's
But I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
So me and you are not alike
And ruined your welcome mat
Jessica Simpson, looks oh so temptin'
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
Invite them in like a One A Day
they coming with bombs, I'm coming with flare-guns
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
Dyke ho, you don't like it
Ffff-fuck...(My dick!) my nuts..
And a piece of plastic bubble wrap
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
Quit horsin' around in this building or you a goner
Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of 'em off
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
background reveals a 1-8-7-2, 'till the block I'm the truth, to the cops I'm the proof
Stay wide awakeMotherfuckers talkin' crazy (yeah)
So I don't plan on stopping at all
So I don't plan on stopping at all
So I don't plan on stopping at all
So I don't plan on stopping at all
So I don't plan on stopping at all
Just stay true to you so
Just stay true to you so
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
I love your personality
I rip (mystikal's) voicebox out, scream in his ear (Ahhhhhh!)
And go about your life, like it was nothing
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
A super bonanza extravaganza.
Put down the scissors, 'fore you do something dumb
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
(Mushrooms killed Kenny! *fart* Ewww, ahhh!)
Ever ever
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is
I done messed around and forgot my TEC
Maybe I'm just ahead of myself
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
For every single die hard fan who embraced me
I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
Cuffing, I'm shoving the girl I love inside of an oven
Hypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Then I let you go and just give
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog?
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
Thank you, God
Yeah, I feel it too.
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow, man
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog
Cause I'll hit yo' ass like the train did that bitch
And it's time to wash out the blonde
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Unlike you 'cause you're on a flight too, but it's a staircase
I'm tired of the games I just want her back
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no.
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, hope you can swim good!
Please, undo your seatbelt for takeoff
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
'Cause we ain't come to hurt no one (one)
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan' (Ayo)
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
Not just based on my description
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
'Cause Dre couldn't make it today
It's still all right cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
There's a baby sister in the mix,
I'm gonna fucking cum
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Than those other little hoes
Young Money...
You don't have to, agree
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin they funds
Straighten up little soldier
You better run and tell someone else,
Everything is so tense and gloom
Girl, you think you're so smart
Girl, you think you're so smart
Girl, you think you're so smart
Girl, you think you're so smart
But especially when you don't know
Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up
and watch mosh pits til motherfuckers knock each other unconcious
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Get your brains blown out
Shit becomes too much to bear
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
They cannot tame or placate the (Ayy)
He kicked it in
But this time I
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
They belong in my scrotum,
Cookie looky, even took me a Polaroid
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
His cup just runneth over, oh no
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
Now we're pouring liquor on the curb in his name for him
Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Some girls are bout it bout it
I wanna fuckin' sing
You write normal? Fuck being normal
The Alaina to my Hailie.
Metaphors wrote on my hand,
It gets all quiet and whispers
Sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more?
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin another bomb 
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
I see those cheeks soaking and wet
Chargin' me, so I gave my hotel key
Tell the critics I'm back and coming to spit it back in abundance
Even if it is Charles Manson who just happens, to be rapping
To tell 'em what's on my mind
To tell 'em what's on my mind
How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
Now just wait 'til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
But I'm contemplating yelling "Bombs away" on the game
Go, go, go!
Love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
I think i'm bottomin' out
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
I keep trying to pass it
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
She don't want to see me with other females out
And no, we ain't pumpkins on Halloween
(I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better)
Listen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
I'm an enigma
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Slim Shady would be somethin that you woulda bought
it's just me being me, here want me to tone it down?
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat
That ain't no reason to start wigging and spaz out
Is you rely on me as much
3 A.M. in the mornin'
Oh yeah
I shoveled shit all my life,
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
New boobs? (Yeah) Where you get them done?
You missing the key, you ain't even in the brisk of the tea
I'll get you there
Now here I am three months later full blown relapse
This little cock-sucker, he must be feelin' himself
"John, where's Dave at before I bash you?"
It feels like I'm talking to myself
It feels like I'm talking to myself
It feels like I'm talking to myself
It feels like I'm talking to myself
You did it, it's your fault
It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?
Ready, set, go! Hit play, record!
And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders.
Yeah, you're a cute fox
A bitch-made man; now, how you gonna connect
Stand above em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Damage already done, y'all should've let me be
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
When you find out, can't escape me whore.
Have Micheal Myers looking like a liar, swipe his powers
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
Ha! Go ahead, yell!
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Come and see me on the streets alone
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
Children quiet down please
Lyrics coming at you with supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
Outsiders, and we suing the courts
I keep on telling you motherfuckers
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
tunk, pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaners, fucked me good, you should of
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
The more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves
DRE! (AH-AH)
did I spit too soon?
It's true that I got shot in the heart
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Especially when the Worlds silly putty in ya hands, its playdough
When you walked through the door you were queer to me
I've caused a few and so have you
But I can't see who he's shooting it out with
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
We got schoolcraft here at the seven-eight and dexter,
To remind me
Wish there wasn't any pain,
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover, 'cause he need it
Last year I was nobody
We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
but I'm too swift and fast
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe {*wolf whistle*}
Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
Body's bananas and sass to go wit'
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?
Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, they'll call me guilty
His son just woke up and he just walks in
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just,
Helplessness
If I bet you, I'll be in tomorrow's paper
You think your hot, you aint even luke warm
Big L got blasted away
I'm lifting you 10 feet (lifting you 10 feet)... in the air
So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn bitches)
Man, here we go
Man, here we go
Man, here we go
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
It's type weird 'cause that made me hotter than my dear
(Six minutes, six minutes)
I buried the Christ corpse
I can carry rap til my back hurts
The door's broken, it won't lock
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square
Finger so high in the air, I bet your senses flip
Me and Dre the steel alloys,
Its all an illusion
Cause the DJ playin' my song
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me
'Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both
So you might wanna go back to the lab tonight and um
Me too, you're burning up
Me too, you're burning up
Me too, you're burning up
A never-was, been claiming rap when it's not yours
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fucking G
My signature ligature marks, look at you all
I ain't "acid rap", but I rap on acid
I'll blow my brains in your lap
So. this. time. I'm goin' in!Obie, yo', i'm sick, damn, you straight dog...
If you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
We ain't friends trying to make amends
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
Our apartment's tore apart
For me to flip
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
From a daddy longleg
No way I'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wed us
the only thing i wait for
'Til I feel anointed
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
Eminem killed by M and M
but if you go back and
None of these skills you bout to see come free
None of these skills you bout to see come free
None of these skills you bout to see come free
None of these skills you bout to see come free
And Irv's so nervous that he
Everybody doin' chick joints
Worth sneaking out to me, the cheap hotel rooms or
Or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and I
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Suck my dick, you fucking suck bitch
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
With methamphetamines in his left hand
'Cause if you doubt me you will, yeah got me a pill, found me a thrill
This is how I'm supposed to be
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylenol
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I think I'm down to a hundred pounds.
Or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?
It's like we're playing lyrical tug of war with your ear. You hear it girl, come here.
Wanted one though, they were so dope (Yeah)
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Oh they can all get fucked.
Oh they can all get fucked.
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Cinderella man
Mom, I know I let you down
Oh, critiquin' my talent?
Deformed fool,taking a shit in a warm pool
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
This the life of a rocker
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
All of a sudden I got 90 some cousins (Hey it's me!)
Knock knock, let the devil in
and yell out loud, "All y'all get the hell out now"
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
I never meant to bring you to my world
I never meant to bring you to my world
I never meant to bring you to my world
I never meant to bring you to my world
I never meant to bring you to my world
I never meant to bring you to my world
I never meant to bring you to my world
I never meant to bring you to my world
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (and she will)
And have some back and forths
By saying shady was ghost I aint even close the gate
Lesson three: Get a job at a label; switch demos with canibus
And all at once just to have somethin' to chew...
I know that makes you real mad, don't it? (Uh-Huh)
Uh, here â€“ DOUBLE XL, DOUBLE XL
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
But then she comes back to me
But then she comes back to me
Eminem and Fuzz, and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
You feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, you're pissed
I've been to bat for this woman
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
Fuck all you
You couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula
'Cause you've been a gold digger since you was a miner
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
This is do or die
This is do or die
This is do or die
This is do or die
Pretending to be blind Superman
(Oh, my God!)
Beating him over the head with the telephone
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform
Left the house, pullin' out the drive backin' out
You end up going out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid
"Regime" is a little extreme
"No one's gonna love you like I do!"
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet.
I'll be standin by the Loch Ness Monster (okay) peace out (bye!!)"
Cause of nervousness that was solely the only verdict
Cause of nervousness that was solely the only verdict
Six semen samples, 17 strands of hair
Make a beeline
I won't have to rape you
Dreamin at night of screamin at mom, schemin to leave
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
I asked him to come to the dark side
I'll shit on you!
Drugs, rock and Hennessy
But in fact
How does it feel: Is it fantastic, is it grand?
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
You got no hitters, you might be pitchin' a shut out
But I think it's workin'
Couldn't agree with ya more, If you were to say that my fuckin shit doesn't stink,
Yeah, boy; let them demons out!
I done said so much fucked up shit, I was born a mistake
Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at,
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
Making his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a motherfucking
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Like the shade in these windows
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
I just tripped over my cape (Superman)
Sippin' Bacardi and lime I start to recollect on the time
All you have is a little stupid can
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol
I say you know, you acting like you don't know
Don't let up, just keep slaying em
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
You're only making this harder on yourself
And to the Republic for which it stands
One to ten shit I must be the holy grail of
Born and raised in the C-P-T, yeah Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva what can you do?
Plus a luxury sedan
With a night pass to the matinee
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Slashin your tires, flyin down Fenkel and Meyers
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
Got your whole crew doing subpeonas
Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.
Who the fuck are you, Superman?
I'm so gone off the hookah
Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina, too.
And we ain't stoppin' until
My inner strength
No shit (Oh)
But I did have a super power though
How come your shirt is so bloody?
How come your shirt is so bloody?
How come your shirt is so bloody?
Enough rhymes to
Yeah!
Sprayin' wreck (Bitch!)
That's about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset
Obie Trice, D-12, G Unit, 50 Cent, Hailie Jade
So nice to meet you
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous
You're fuel to my fire
Nothing like Son of Sam, so please understand
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
But they're really your enemies, with secret identities
And on and on and on (and on and on)Yeah.
So focused on the bright side
You see I never really asked for much
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair
Puffy is good, (Hey!) but Slim Shady is for the children! (Wait!)
Killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent
I'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumbling back
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
Am I trying to show her how? Let me slow it down some. It's still gonna be a blow out.
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
But I've still got a lot of growing up to do
And I give you the news with a twist
I don't cut the beat 'til I fuckin' destroy it
I murk her with a Mossberg
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
Of trying to fake
They after that Shady - Aftermath money
Swing one last time
Kiss my dick, get my cash
Look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug!" (Sorry!)
And I'mma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm tired of not having a phone
All this tension dispensing these sentences
Eminem you wait till' we meet up again
I'm like houdini,
Pull up behind you while you're leaving and you don't even know it (ayo, Rick, man)
Always pullin' devices
If they were brown, Shady lose, Shady sits on the shelf,
Strapped with a grenade, in the pool with your mama
Just about, belted out whatever spouted or fell out my smart aleck mouth it was so weird
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
There aint no boy who can do what I do boy I'm a star,
And I ain't playin', you a brother getting cheated
I'm a glutton for punishment
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
So don't blame me (evil twin)
The plan's to bring you to my house
So come here baby boy, just come here to me
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
It's a trap, fuck my last CD the shit's in my trash,
And for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life
You can act a fool if you wanna (bitch)
I need scope 'cause my breath stinks
Next time you'd show restraint
Who would've thought I could ever be such a relentless prick
'Cause I related to the struggles of Young America
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
And I'm frozen 'cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
Used to be my fiancÃ©e, 'til you sucked on Wayne, AndrÃ© and Kanye,
Unleashing his vengeance
Besides static pain and Big Daddy Kane
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white

Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?
You felt my heat, rubbing off on you
for anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
Perform the home abortion with Dexter
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
But I'ma make you eat your words

I'm sliding down a slippery slope
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Michael would like an apology what
And love is "evol"
I don't give a fuck who you are
The devil only knows of this world
With the stress this game is giving me... 
My pair ol' shoot like sky divin' in Hammer pants
Tin brain, prolly fucked in the membrane
Am I too nice?
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
You better be strapped with a derringer
When it happened I had an epiphany
With the stress this game is giving me...
What do you have in common?
Slim Shady shit sounds like a fable to me
And you're looking way thinner
The way that you turned your back on me
They should have never let us get off foot in this game...
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
What else can I do, I haven't got a clue
These niggas is trippin'
The only way that I am able
But neither one of us would ever admit it,
Talking about I fabricated my past
But she wasn't aware, I was there, or maybe she was, and just didn't care
(don't know what I'm gonna do)
To speak and be heard
Lately I really feel like I'm rolling for delf like Philly,
I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Pick up lighteninâ€™ bolts and throw â€˜em
I think I'll put a piece of art on my visa card,
I come home every single day from working double shifts
But what good is a fuckin' recovery if I fumble it?
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
I trust that everyone is enjoying the music
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac
Wait is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
When I'm layin' here with you,
I sees three little kids, up in the front row,
I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real
In fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em
Your VCR tape cases with you Ambient CR great places to hide ain't it
Promising complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
It's they who mistake me and make me so angry
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
When will the madness end, how can it when
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
I'm like Two-Face, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
DJ Polo, Tony D, ODB, Moe Dee, Run-DMC
And through my hair when ordeals I'm so vain
Cause all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had
It's something to see
In the arm and pay homage, pupil
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
Give every kid who got played that
And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
when they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet (Huh?)
I think about the things I would've never got to say to you.
but his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
Never looking back
Who just happened to be a rapper
I said, "Go with you where?" She said "Out"
I'm sorry mama!

Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW!
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I just love condoms and lots of cum, no? Oh, shit.Ballin' Uncontrollably
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow
She cut me off on the freeway
To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
And I ain't talking 'bout a pencil
I think I might just do something a little less subtle,
Man chill, nah I can't god dammit
You can see the sparks from hot metal
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me
Who the fuck's Milo?
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
Bitch I'mma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
You weren't supposed to agree, you fucking bitch!
I became a hypocrite
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
As the blade I push into captcha
Iâ€™m so up, Iâ€™m stuck in mid air Iâ€™m lovinâ€™ it yeah
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
The enforcer, look at the more women to torture
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, haha

Here today, gone tomorrow
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody
I find the package and I'm cool,
and beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
I could sweat her to some degree
Gave alyssa milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea (You're a dick!)
We fear how we feel inside
We fear how we feel inside
Right outside of the window of my living room
i got a million bucks in the banks and 8 trucks
Okay, let me see, how could I begin?
But you pushed me to the limit. What a pity
Spin, grab Denaun's guitar and Honky Tonk ya
That's why I'm swingin' at these chicks on-site
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic
So what you hollering and yelling about
So you might not hear sirens at all
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope
Fucking lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Creep with me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane
D.M.C. we have a mid 30s male
Me and my man Howard and Butta would go to the mall with 'em
It's like. you. don't. want. me to win
It's like. you. don't. want. me to win
It's like. you. don't. want. me to win
It's like. you. don't. want. me to win
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Severin, legs, arms, damn there goes another limb
'Cause I never went gold off one song
Someone's gonna touch my body
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
You wouldn't do what,
Like an Air Conditioning knob
Panic attack cause I'm claustrophobic
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love
You're only twenty-four but you're plenty more mature
Then there's really nothin else to say (sing along)
You feelin' blue, too late
Whipping human ass, throwing blows, cracking jaws
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Three's not a crowd all up in it, slow fire
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like
I put that on everything like ranch, I'll never land
You're a supernova... and I'm a
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
We waited in the blistering cold for you
Screaming "fuck, shit, fuck"
Don't snap, it's supposed to be grabbed
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour
(Sorry!)
Payroll (Nice), might put you on a table
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
Mush the Senate's face and push this generation
His life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (pew)
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
To have one last heart-to-heart
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
BTOV
Remember me? ("I drop bombs like Hiroshima")
Like a win-window
Like a win-window
Like a win-window
In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin once
And stop interrupting you're not even up in the conversation
I'd never get to make it right. So, here's what I came to do.
I'm the beatiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went!
and started helpin him stomp me
is all we need in this world
is all we need in this world
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo...
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Underground, pop, or nameless, whatever your job is
Think you spit the rawest
Long time since I shouted them out, bout time
So rest in peace to Bugz and proof
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Because what's stolen from me barely broke even
ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on fifty it's funny
Boo!
'Til your bones poke through your skin
Of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic
We ain't the same, you and I
There's no need to say shit you already know
There's no need to say shit you already know
There's no need to say shit you already know
There's no need to say shit you already know
There's no need to say shit you already know
the rest of us follow suit
the rest of us follow suit
I stood up and said, "Fuck you punk" and I took off and ran
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
It's the time of the season, when hate runs high
And square dance with me!
And square dance with me!
And square dance with me!
And square dance with me!
And square dance with me!
And to anybody I thought about going at, it was never nothing personal, just some shit I was going through
Took a stab in the dark and broke the tip
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
I'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.
I'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.
I'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.
I'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.
I'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.
I'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.
Escaping me, no dice, you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Fine nobody wants to play with me 
Ah Wait a minute
But so what this beef is like 
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Anywhere else in the world right now
Looking to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
He's been praying for me
So blatantly, but silently 'cause I know that she's sound 'sleep
And while you're burning the past, standing in the inferno and chant
His fuckin' dad walkin' out
(rape your mother, kill your parents)
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
But I am coming for closure
Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
I don't need you as much as I really need you
cause those're my best
Or be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
If I don't try to record as much before I do
Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully search the den
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
I said "What is it, another nigga? It's ok"
Pass the hot dogs (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?)
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop
I still love your mother, that'll never change.
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd fans
When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)
When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)
When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)
When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)
I'd yank my fucking teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue
Speak of the devil  It's attack of the rain man 
I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (uh-huh huh)
I wonder what's on the tube
Did you find someone new?
Did you find someone new?
Alright, I'mma lay the chorus first
I just adapt to the climate, I treat it like my Levi's
And your own fans are laughin' at you?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Have I sold it cheap is it greed
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
if 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
But that's how she attracts men, though
Hit every single store, flash a fucking wad of cash
You're my entire supply
And at the end of my run
I'll do it, pop and gobble it and start wobblin'
To the new, Que SerÃ¡
Okay, yeah
You always rap first, 
With sugar plums.
(bust it bust it)
I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne
A secret passageway around here man there's got to be one
How far will he take it?
How far will he take it?
How far will he take it?
How far will he take it?
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story,
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why.
Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch
Turn me into
Uncle Marshall!
They took away dinner (chooka)

Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo

Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Can't, specifically describe it I just can't seem to give a reason
Them haters hatin on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
And blew up my-my-myself again
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Who's itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than chris-topher
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
("Grady!")
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
FUCK THAT! PBBT! You faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
Space Jam Jordans
Or am I truly psychotic, or my molecules just diabolical,
Come back and shoot the club up with a fo'-fo' (a fo'-fo')
I never saw him run so fast in my life
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
I won't give up
There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this

You hear the beat as it makes you not wanna go to sleep.
To this day I, still get in fights with the same broad
Don't want to, I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
Other side of my back and stuck a spike, too, should've
I cut 'em off, I got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
I'd laugh while you wept
In Harlem
Don't have to prove anything
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
He don't owe them bitches shit
I need a change of pace 'cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
"Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
(Hey, hey, hey!)
Man! (I swear!)
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Ha ha, you feel that baby?
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tell flaw with heat
I got my hands on something great
I got my hands on something great
Gettin' recruited at eighteen
Everybody halts and stops, and calls the cops
They make it all up, there's no such thing
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
Who ain't have shit to do with it, like Cool J does (My tattoo!)
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Look at, Kim
Eat a fuckin' dick (yeah)
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I wouldn't, not even if I could
Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
And sit up front; I'm not asking, it's a trap
Ready to snap any moment I'm

Ready to snap any moment I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
Word to Uncle Ron
He's not a desperado he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Girl, you give me writer's block
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans, exploding
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying
Other day someone got all elaborate
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
I won't topple I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
I consider me and Nickel identical, but not us
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself
Sipped it on the way out as I dipped, I wanna rip the road up
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
And you think I'm gross and unsexy
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a Jeep full of people
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension
Must've been true because man we done banned they shoes
And make her fall on her face and
Half you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage, rest of you got lap bands
It's OK to be scared-straight they said I provoked queers
It'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way
The more you, put me through,
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
Fuck you
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
But I am trying to find a way to get you alone (car note)
And maybe that's a bad habit.

So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
Ever heard of Aspergers'? It's a rare condition
Everyone's got 'em, thought that you were Cinderella but (Yeah)
Better text message your next of kin, tell em shits about to get extra messy especially when I flex again
Less than two hours later, but I fought it
Hiding down ducking strays from frustrated youths stuck in their ways
Someone get this Aryan a sheet
But if not for my financials
What you Mariah, fly through twice
But when all is said and done
Hey the prodigal son
You can try this at home
Cause I grab the mic and get DOWN, like Syndrome
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
Some shit about a message you left 
Squeeze it then squash it then pass it to a friend
The Twin Eagles ol' air his coup might as well ride by in the ambulance
Like I'm not, the one you wanna contest, see
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
That's why every time you mention a lyric
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow.
Homie, I'm the ScheiÃŸe, ask Doctor Dreizehn
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful
Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a Benzo
'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
I'm dying to breathe
I'm dying to breathe
I'm dying to breathe
I'm stumbling, I can't see straight
But I'mma still get dark on this shit.
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent

Missouri for Michigan didn't work
Fuck is that? Stop hammering (God)
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead"
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Be candy paintin' the neighborhood kids
My mom
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
I know what this looks like, officers
I know what this looks like, officers
I know what this looks like, officers
Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
Aunt Edna always told me "Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that"
You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
if they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come
if they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come
But it's like I payed the price of fame twice I hate it

It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
That I'm enchanting, with the romantic
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...)
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush,

Drugs really got a hold of me
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch I'm a droid
C'mon! Relax guy, I like gay men
'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Bumstickitty, bumstickitty, bum huh
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
'Cause I ain't playing around
But how do you keep up the pace
Everybody bores me,
You a slut but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,
Garbage bag for one of the windows
But if it don't, then ya'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and

Never fading, and I know that haters are forever waiting
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)

Two more exits, time is quite near
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
I feel like I'm morphing into something that's so incredible that I'm dwarfing all competitors.
How did you get so big?
and gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it
I'm wasting punchlines but I got so many to spare I just thought of another one that might go here
Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me
Need a backin' out this lady's Jag started blackin' out
Cause this is my space, you invade it
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches

Welcome to Mom and Dadâ€™s crazy world
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
The taste of your own medicine, here come a dose of it
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Consider the last four minutes as

Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Then we cuss each other, out,

The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
Paint be flyin' off my car
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
Word to Pacquiao, mama said there ain't nothing else to talk about
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon blew and
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Bin Laden on my ass

Told me she was going back into using again
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit
And just asked him to come crash
Nowhere to go but hysterical.
But you don't give a fuck
Annually knockin' the boots
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Of pills, think your boy is startin'
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
Checked in at the Royal Garden
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
but we'll see, cause we ain't lookin' for beef
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...
And hips and licked them lips and that was it

Where they pop toasters, and they live with their moms
The words that we meant that we didn't say
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
But I don't compete with nobody
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
Let's bounce tonight
Flashin' bread, roll down the window
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
Dirty Harry
No, Zack! Don't go back in there!
Used to smell the roses
We learn to let shit go, but then again
'Cause both of us are still involved, so
Too much pride between you and I
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
Why does everyone always leave me?
But suddenly, I feel my heart

Or you're the kind of girl that I can take a liking to
Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together
Guess I'm lucky,
Yeah, y'know! What's crackin Dre?
Only realized it was ironic
I only get naked when the baby sitter tells me She showed me a movie like "Nightmare on Elm Street"
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more

Did it even occur to you that I loved you?
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Show 'em why you're you
And some cum-wad from out the parking lot
At least sound, I sound like these clowns, like he sound
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
I can hear the music continue to crescendo
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black

If so to what extent
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!
It's different them last two albums didn't count
And they used to use my mother fuckin' trailer to tease me with
I need a new boyfriend." Hi. My name is JoJo.
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But the word "fucking" ain't meant to be a descriptive word
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
Guys, when someone you'd die for
When I rap I represent it and will never referee in it
Hi there, bitch...
You beef with me, I'mma even the score equally
You know what happens when I'm around, man
Hirin' strippers, prostitutes retirin'
But I take the same advice I had
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's 'foul' but my dicks on 'strike'
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are

Security's gone I'm trapped in the club
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed? 
I know this time Paul and Dre
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
My brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn
With his own private plane, his own pilot
You're frightened like "This guy might hurt me"
Pharmaceuticals, glue stick to crucify me at Bonnaroo
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, "Fuck the world!"
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Swish but don't spit it, swallow when I finish
when a thousand bullets come at your house
Kiss my butt. Lick the fumunda cheese from under my nuts
Baby, make us some French toast and show us some skin 
I'm just being honest, I can see the comments
Yes, babe, I'm fallin' in likeness kinda, why I love

Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
Outsiders, Pace One, Young Zee.

Neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' Marines

'Cause I was trying to leave No Doubt
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me

("Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?")
You are the ink to my paper
So bitch, shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Jessica Alba, put a breast on my mouth, bruh
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just the
He goes, "You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now"

Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
So I'm warning you, don't coax me
Step up to the target

Facin' the door, remainin' patient while stayin' complacent
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh-no he didn't!

But she swallowed my fucking leg whole like an egg roll
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old,
You wanna criticize, dog? Try a little mo'

Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
Fuck I'm gonna start letting off
In my own words I guess...
Sorry if I'm being graphic, but I'm stiff as a statue
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
You 'bout one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave,
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me
And your mental state's deteriorating slow
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
But see me on the street and duck
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Car crash, shows what they know
Truly yours the idiotic Bizarre
And make em come to your basement and listen
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat, Dre fall off that's news to meI never meant to give you mushrooms girl
You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
I'd rather hear 'em say "Die N-word" than Die Antwoord
'Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MCs
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I'm back (Slim Shady)
(I'm screamin' out no regrets) Can't do it, nah
He hit me I fell, I got back up all I did was book, now there's using your head
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
That butt won't ever give up
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
Who can say for sure?
that somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
Like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
Just let me rest my head in between that set of Ds
Be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
It's tragical, thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
Let's call your sister three-way
Very sexually active, very.
Michael, my knife go right hand
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 
She thinks I'm bein' mean and now
You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
His metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
One slug
I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
From boy to man, it's still make a whore moan like a thyroid gland
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
Another terrorist attacks
His name is (Marshall!)
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Hundred percent cut, no stitches required
But shit's about to hit the shingle
But shit's about to hit the shingle
But shit's about to hit the shingle
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
I love you babyAw man...
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's sweet
Fuck slugs I'm walkin gloves with a shotgun
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alrightHello
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
You all c'mon now
You all c'mon now
You all c'mon now
You all c'mon now
You all c'mon now
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin - throw up on the mic
The whole substance to my rap.
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?
Lindsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya
Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
With M-16's and ten clips each
Screaming, "Fuck the police!" like cop porn
They were sleeping, I made 'em stop snorin'
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a fucking year
(It makes them stay in a trance, No choice, they have to dance)
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan
i cant explain what it is my brain does
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
Shove a diamond up my hind end,
After they sip piss through Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Jealous of me, know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about
And this load is like the weight of the world
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Full magazine could take Staples out
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Dum, tahh-dum.. ta-dah-da
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
I'll slap you off that bar stool
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress,
You gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
Proof's room slept on the floor of the motel then
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Until the day I started following your feetprints
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her.
But I won't back down
But I won't back down
But I won't back down
But I won't back down
I struggle with coming to my senses
The rap crown royals,
Got a whole generation of rappers coming up that are nutty with the flow
Guys, sucked eight/nine men
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
You're submitting to skill, sitting still
The press is about to go ape shit bananas on all the networks
And here's an autograph for your brother
I just bake cookies, Mr. Officer, looky, take a whiff of this
Little punk!
I know I'm a liar
I think a living never meant for me
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
I'm from Atlanta
Made 'em break out the popcorn
I'm having a stroke of genius, Elizabeth I'm coming to you, honey
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
You motherfuckas ain't smoking 
A lot of people ask me.. am I afraid of death..
And smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what your saying
Got no ring on this finger now
Dressed like a sailor, standing by a pale of garbage
I love you, Bean
But all bullshit aside I hit a stride
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
('Cause I wouldn't have been me)
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shit stain I thought
OK I'm done
I'm at a loss for words, uhh
My mother started screamin, "What are you on, drugs?!?
Hope so, now hoe...
It's almost 4 in the morning and you're in a
And ride it like a motorbike
Money'll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it
(then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin)
(then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin)
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

Then mosy on over to Rosie-o-Donnell's
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
I'm a pitbull off his leash
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Thutmose the Third, seven inch herringbones
What you think I'm kiddin' you?
Behind the boards sits Dre, legends are made this way
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)
Have some bullshit to readjust
And if a nigga's still out there you just gotta shoot, I carry over my street ethics to the booth
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
I couldn't see your ass gonna Heaven
But you gotta get your fire back
Turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Fuck it, let's all stand upYou claim if you get knocked by the cops
Just feels like we're a lot different.
Night club, shit, I was taught if your CD's on fire
And half of them ain't even funny like
There's so many other motherfuckers that just are
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
please don't cry for me, when i'm gone for good,
I harbor the art, of you nice wear
Lose your best friend from highschool, your wife too
Come hizzon, what kinda fuzukin' quizition is that?
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced
One day I plan to be a family man happily married
Hi, faggot
For weapon concealin'
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
With the ugly Kardashian
Or gets ya description an' sketches ya
Jose Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no
Ha plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boys, is all that I fetch
Throw up then gas, lungs collapse
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed
if you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought
'Til one day I grew suspicious, when I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
Don't try to deny it, baby, I'm the only one for you
Please tell me what happened with
Please tell me what happened with
Please tell me what happened with
And it don't stop oh
And it don't stop oh
And it don't stop oh
And it don't stop oh
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart, I sniff it
Try and awake
How they attacked the victim
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
Shit, fuck everything...
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh)
Looked around the room
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Just so that I don't explode
because he's so caught up in that snow white
After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Question is are you both so smart enough to feel stupid
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin' you look down
Fucking doctor, I didn't understand a damn what he said I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother.
Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with ya gal but
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, "Fuck it"
He's no longer getting them free
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neuman mad cerebral
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy
My image I have zero time or regard for
Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
Look them dead in the eye,
And a paychecks that were stuffed in a glove box
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
They all trying to get that stamp
You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so
Fuck the handle I fly off the hinge Let that boy off the bench, coach and throw it to him 
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And thereâ€™s nothinâ€™ else to say so I may aswell fly away
Lackin' with it, "he ain't spittin' like this on his last shit"
But I was put here not by accident
But you got a hard on for me. What you hollering my name for?
Now which one of you bitches down for the cause
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
To attack her character,
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
Shady Limited's in any size yo, Denim
I'm taking my life back)
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
I find it complicated just to hold a conversation
Get on down
I say everyday she be givin it up
Yeah, I'm open season
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass
I'm sorry weâ€™re alone
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's cube
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
there's somethin' about a white boy talking black and runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
This Brandy got my swinging
cum soon, and work that nigga, like a slave owner, when I dropped off my outfit, she knew I
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
Hi, how can I help you?
now I'm next, let's see who
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
A mic in my hand's a weapon (What?)
Propane takin' my cranium
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
When you want something bad enough to steal
You can already sense the climate is starting to shift
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
I got you caught up in the rapture
We'll start it out with caviar, Don Parigne
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records;
You 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
They said I was a gimmick, now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)
I did my best, I tried to change
And I'm sick of acting humble thats enough of that
I get the point. Fine. Me and Mommy are going."
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Translation, I will probably kill us both
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
dem better to ring the alarm boy,
Here's to the land that raised me
Here's to the land that raised me
Here's to the land that raised me
She's pro'ly six foot tall like bigfoot, the hell with that?
I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider
And leave you like that
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The principal walked in (What's going on in here?)
A couple of cocktails will send me to jail
You'll just make me stronger than I was
You'll just make me stronger than I was
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
And though you say the days are happy
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
I don't have any lines to go right here so, chubba teletubbie!
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissing people for no reason?
'Cause the way that I'm feeling tonight, everything I can just do right
And it's down right blasphemous
You get the new LL Cool J cooling system
In fact I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves
They cant sit, I donâ€™t think anybody understands it
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin about his millions
I just flip 'em the bird
I just flip 'em the bird
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
I look so sunburnt
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song learned who to aim it on
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
I walk up on ya, "Well, hello Tonya"
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Get down, down, down (Baby!)
Is you're the legs to my table
I'm like a fuckin wasp in the hospital lost
Every day
Dem know what's coming boy,
And you're a good person too
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
And I might snap, one day just like that
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells since yours ain't working out
Now look at all the pain I caused
Before I push this motherfucking button and blast off
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
Stop dwellin', then stop yellin'
You remind me of my mother
By a craze lunatic with a gun
Pull it, squeeze it, 'til it's empty
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson
I will sit on you
I will sit on you
You're snake-bitten with myâ€”venom
You sold your soul to me. Need I remind you?
Stingin the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
("Damn!")
Ha ha! Woo!
You 'bout to experience euphoria
to see the look on ya fake mugs
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
Designed by a cartoon
Cause I'm always shittin when I'm rappin like master p (Unnnggggh!)
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the minis
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
The way we act
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
Girl, take this pole like a survey
A beautiful face is all that you have
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
everyone's making a stink about me
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And if I ever do live to be a legend
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot
I'm crying inside, I shout
I ain't placin' any blame,
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
You're witnessing a mass-occur like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Here we go now, doe-se-doe now, curtains up, the show must go
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
It's in their best interest to protect their investment.
The kinda crazy you can't fix
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I made
I heard a noise, where you goin'? What are you, bananas?!
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
Shit I laughed in his face spit
my uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
I'ma tell you the story
With a bottle full of malt liquor
Running around your backyard swimming pools
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
God, why did you take him?
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
Give out from underneath me
But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
Words in the way, I'm at loss by him
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo scented
Arsenic writer, author with arthritis
Iâ€™m coming to get that quarter back
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho
When you feel like you've had it up to here
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
You let my devil come out me
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Hell yeah!)
You got some views, but you're still below me
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Why be a king when you can be a God?Aw, yeah (It's like this, like this)
Misplacin' my anger enough to give Earl and Tyler, The Creator the brunt yeah
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
One of you tries to grab a knife
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
Simmer down
However I do show some respect to few
Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted
C'mon, yeah!!Ugh, you're a monster
another story, for surely, the pussy on toast after we toast, her clothes fell like bishop in
(Why are you doing this?)
When I take back what's mine, with pleasured hands
Im feeling won-der-ful,
Shit, if you only knew the half of it
My mother thought I was such a fun little boy
Like Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
I spilled like, like forty bottles
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
This is my dance song (Outsidaz)
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
(Slim Shady)
(Slim Shady)
(Slim Shady)
Taking My Ball and going home, hooome,
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
I make you think you're a backstabber
I make you think you're a backstabber
I make you think you're a backstabber
I make you think you're a backstabber
I make you think you're a backstabber
I make you think you're a backstabber
I make you think you're a backstabber
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
Yo, look at her bush. Does it got hair? (Uh huh!)
I choke mic's like asphyxiation when I'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin'
I've swallowed all I could
I'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
The death of Doody broke us in two
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And bust open like broken water mains
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
My name is Marsh and, my name is, my name is
That image burned in my brain
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
For the next four and a half minutes
Would've ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
I immediately run
So emotions enough to say "fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!" 
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
With every faggot you slaughtered
Straight jacket with a hundred eight brackets
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
I can spit in ya face while your standin' across from me, no apologies
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
Getting money anytime I want owning my own businesses and all that,
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion
Cause I hear the track and I'm starting to get fucking amped
Think about it before you walk in the door first
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
Girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
Why am I here, am I just wasting my time?
Fuck that! Do that shit! Shoot that bitch!
Have a party (turn the music up)
They get hated on in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop
And walk around with my pants hanging over my butt
Candy Rain-ass nigga, he got a deal, now he rappin'
The music you accuse me of tryna destroy
My computers will be seized and my keys to my ranch
It's my own insecurities!
My OCD's conking me in the head
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
Di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grÃ¢ce
My rap style's warped
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounce and grab a pair of stilts
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Yeah, it's been a ride
I ain't finished, bitch
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
Or still yet to be determined?
Find an escape
It's playing our song.
But what do I do? It's locked.
Strappin' with the audience as we perform hypersong
So Drake
Stick a fork in and turn
The passion and the flame is ignited
White America, little Eric looks just like this,
White America, little Eric looks just like this,
White America, little Eric looks just like this,
White America, little Eric looks just like this,
White America, little Eric looks just like this,
White America, little Eric looks just like this,
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
I leave you stymied, that's why they still vilify me like Bill O'Reilly
Take a little bit of this fluoride rinse
Such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
you where there when shit got thick
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake
That last "Relapse" CD was "ehh"
Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
when I shout
You're the cause of my pain and the medicine
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
Give me Donkey of the Day
Now I know you're feelin discouraged but homie just mark my words
Even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
(I hope you offended)
A lot's happened in between them since I rised to this fame
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
Then we duke it out, then it dies down
It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of getting my hair pulled
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Every school I went
I've never seen no shit like this in my life before
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Come together let's all form and swarm just a little
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Depending on your mood, if it swings, think too many things
You wanna see fights I got a match for you
I ain't gone even ask
And said that Puma's The Brand 'cause the Klan makes Troops
Sales decline, the curtains drawn
This is the only thing that I'm good at
Without me knocking your block off
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
I donâ€™t see why these people always got my back
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
(their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
Now those days are over, scrapin' change in sofas
Like trying to start over
Got murdered in cold-blood
Yo! I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
but that's the last thing
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
Once upon a time where all we had
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
I am the bad guy, Kryptonite: The Green Chronic
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"
Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets
So bye for now
You're just small pokes little pricks
Yes siree, 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
But fuck the world 'cause they out to get us
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
Passionate ass-whooping and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
My point is this
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
You'll all get shot whether it's your fault or not, 'cause
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher
To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
Affable guy next door is laughable
Hello allow me to introduce myself
Iâ€™m on top of this thing so i may aswell fly away
Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few
And that's the only word I can think of right now
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
I'm buzzing, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Susan stop crying I don't hate ya
When it's time to walk away
I put both hands on your throat
God there's an exit comin' up, what the mother F-U-C-K's
And it's as though you feel you've died
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
And we're both adults, so there's no excuse
Let us beg to differ
As a goodbye note, 'cause your dad's at the end of his rope
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
Yeah, move it or lose it freak, move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably
Damn, I'm (Yeah) getting too fuckin' old for this (Yeah)
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
All my life I was very deprived
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!
This always happens
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
Or you might end up found dead by the lake
And they cheated, they lie like Amerigo
Dazed and I'm so confused
But I won't be made a fool of,
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
Thinkin' if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him
But I ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
My hands have been cuffed
Quit worrying about what they do and do shady
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam.
I just wanna be famous,
I just wanna be famous,
I just wanna be famous,
I'm bad enough to commit suicide
Proof spit his verse,
Fuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
The minute we spot ya, the semi'll pop, nigga, we got ya
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
I'm a keep eating 'till Richard Simmons comes to my house
Fuck you, die you son of a bitch
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
'Cause I'm stronger than I was
'Cause I'm stronger than I was
I'm drunk. So, Satan, take the fucking wheel
And that very well may be the same reason they don't say me
And awake with a headache
You were shittin on us too
Alright, aight, aight, aight, aight, aight
Leave these pussies stretched out like the Octomom
They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head
'Cause right now I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
Good God, dip, do a little slide
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at this
Honey I applaud that ass
Thats in the back of my mind,
Blow them up if they ain't want me
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
You wear your heart on your sleeve. I sport that white tank boy.
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
I just want to be just like you
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
What's occurring before, after and during the show
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
Five dozen, flies buzzin' over your head
And so I'm saying,
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
Run your motherfuckin pockets, ASAP
Live half my life and throw the rest away
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
Word, Rick, word, man, you heard, but don't get discouraged, girl
For I am Triumph, the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold
While I'm holding a pistol with this many calibres here?? (here??)
I just bodied the beat, so that hoe must've been dug
Only good for cooking, cleaning
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough so
when running with the long arm of the law I'm long gone
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta, a stupid piece a
The cops in my Nana crib, but I'm not there
I'm in the Slick Rick eye patch, but I got it from Hex
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot
On these bogus pochers,
Then we say, "Fuck it", cry our eyes out
You're ass backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
I just can't get past these little pissants
But I sure as hell got it backwards cause y'all could get jumped
Make â€˜em swarm, make â€˜em fight over the shirts Iâ€™ve worn
Cause this shit is getting embarrassing, the fog is thick and the air is thin
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
'Cause I'm in Hell
'Cause I'm in Hell
'Cause I'm in Hell
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Oh, God, my brain is racing
Now we are trapped on the throne
Now we are trapped on the throne
Now we are trapped on the throne
You tryna snort on my keys?
Iâ€™m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
"I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?!?"
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
Return of the no good
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
Found down unresponsive
My will I'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
Time to get rid of these rap criminals
that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Be ready to come off the top as sharp position
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
I diarrhea on track so it needs plunging
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealing
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
He may seem as though he's plain normal
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk) shake your body
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outtie
I don't know it's just the way I am
I think I love you too
I think I love you too
I think I love you too
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
Some are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Some are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
And fuck was the first word I ever learned
Trapped in his own drawings
So this would be the part of the song
So this would be the part of the song
"Trunk Muzik, Yelawolf's better", fuckin' bitch
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
I'm the American dream! I'm the definition of white trash balling,
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party!
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party!
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party!
Wonder would they even call? When the music stops
If he gang bangin' or not
You can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it
and I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
Flows tighter, hot headed as Ghost Rider
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
To the whacko 'fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
For the god in the flesh, the ominous Indominus Rex
Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
Givin you shit bitch - don't even bother askin me (Get away from me!)
Through your living room window
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
Mr. Don't-Give-A-Fuck still won't leave
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Not over 'till we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
Yo, I put that shit on a greatest hits album
And take away their freedom like you did to me
I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
It's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
it takes nutz
Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nike's
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
OK, hello it's the Martian
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones
If you agree to repeat after me, I Love You (I love you baby)
"Whoops!"
So get your gun and if you comin
so goodbye, goodbye Hollywood,
"This is for every time you took my orange juice,
Don't worry, man those bullets will still be at your ass firin'
Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights yeah
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Remember me? ("Slam! Slam!")
Naw man, haha
I said get up!
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Days that I don't know who
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free

We probably, probably, probably
The last Mathers LP done went diamond
But Suge has Irv's on a string
Homosexual dissector
God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
Probably end up baggin' the cocktail waitress
and I consider myself one of those
and I consider myself one of those
and I consider myself one of those
I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
So kids say no to drugs (say no)
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Yes suh', ya texta' is bitch...
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Woke up shortly thereafter, hungover
Yeah maybe that explains
And all we do is shove each other,
Bitch it's you I tore out the frame, I win
You are the prime target
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
Use the tools you're given!
That I won't be making a mistake
Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speaking mine or Timbaland's name
Maybe that's what drew us
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep.
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep.
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep.
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep.

Five-finger discount
Really don't mean nothing although
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out"
Lyrical rascal, kick back the Tabasco
Or Godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on
Who's that in the cool blue back
I got a hunch like your back when it's arching
And it sounds like I forget I'm a father and I push it farther, so, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
Off a plank and
'Cause one minute I'm hollerin', "Screw you"
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Here we go again from heroes to villains
Then I'll go meet Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
I hate that I'll never get to say "I hate you" to your face
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

From outta nowhere, you might find your career
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)
B.I.G. 2000 Born Again.. c'mon..
They said I can't rap about being broke no more
We perish in the blast,
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
Matter of fact it was just the other night
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
It's the path I've chosen to go
I'm done being your punching bag
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
Gotta love it, cause I expose the facade
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
I'm gonna fackin' cum
I'm gonna fackin' cum
I'm gonna fackin' cum
And I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin

Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Wrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Lost in a ball of confusion
How should I begin it and where does it all end
How should I begin it and where does it all end
How should I begin it and where does it all end
How should I begin it and where does it all end
How should I begin it and where does it all end
How should I begin it and where does it all end
Inside the depths of his basement

I just never had the chance to ever meet you
So yeah dad let's walk
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where
She's on my Johnson.
Now you're slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
Time to separate the sheep from goats (yeah)
They say I never knew which way I was goin
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancing
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
Look at me work wizardry with these words
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
Lose your tooth and nails
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out.
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador of the valentines day massacre slash assassin
You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
But now it's, lay me down to sleeping
What?
For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece 
Grow up? Nah
That got me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
under my Long Johns
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
One shot two shot three shots four shots
One shot two shot three shots four shots
One shot two shot three shots four shots
One shot two shot three shots four shots
One shot two shot three shots four shots
And just make him say what he wants him to say
I'll shit on anybody
Don't wanna be without you
I've been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
Directly aimin' a gat at my head
Into a motherfucking crime scene?
I never had any of this shit planned, mom, please believe
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
And it backfires in your face hard
Please do not remove me from this movie theater please
I'm running...
I'm running...
I'm running...
and no one lied to
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
As the title of the album suggests
Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
I want you to understand something
Like the gas in the tank, she gettin' low on me
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr."
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
Bring the shaun dawn, burn marajaun, do what you want
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent J
I'm the ringing in your ears
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, i'm trapped
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
To stay so stable
Everyday's just a holiday
Homie, I know I'm never gonna be the same without you
End up running back into them all
End up running back into them all
End up running back into them all
Submerged like a submarine
Contemplating my next plot again
I can make her spin around
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Bobby Creek
I know you want me girl
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Nah, ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touchÃ© me
This is crazy, the way we act when we confuse hip-hop
(I'm screamin' out no regrets)
Clinically insane, brain is on Venus suck Uranus
Inside your world
I hang with a bunch of hippies
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
they took away my right to bear arms
Telling me to be positive
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Making an excuse for us to act it out
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
on your chest
Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
In the faces of in this democracy of hypocrisy
My dreams come to fruition
Motherfuckin', difficult yeah, 'til then hopefully ya
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
All day, all day, all night
All day, all day, all night
All day, all day, all night
Big bags of the grass, Zig-Zags, I'm with the Doc, so
My flow (My flow), still a psycho (Psycho), killer (Killer)
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
For turning your fucking back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?
I think it went wandering off down yonder
I come home and clean up your mess
Sometimes I feel like
Sometimes I feel like
Sometimes I feel like
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
You can have corn rows inside your hair
Stay wide awake
Stay wide awake
Stay wide awake
I meant in half, oil the blades
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because...
Stoop to someone's level (Yeah)
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics?
And when they drop me, I'm randomly sockin' fans
Lets get into it You smoking with the triest and truest 
I love pissin' you off
Location of the woods
Fuck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
so there'll be more for me (Hippie! God damnit!)
Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
Two years, but you left on the first of May
Fanny packs, hourglasses
and sells a couple of million records
Thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
And everyone who has doubt, remind
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
when i come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
I'm tired of committing so many sins
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncy ball
Who the fuck passed you the mic and then said that you can flow?
Make your mama be like "Ohh! This is good! Who sing this?"
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?
I told em, "Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth? Girl, your mans is like in the booth
All them foster homes.",
(kill kill kill)
(kill kill kill)
If only I wasn't travelling down this road by my lonely
You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
But like a wedding band
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty
We're outtie, five thousand
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
Heh, the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said "Hey Bitch..
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
And make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
Why do they try to fight today?
So who's bringin the guns in this country? (Hmm?)
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Band just making my neck itch
Fuck that shit, bitch
Shady
I ain't waste nine bullets on you for you to not sing no hooks
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
Switch it up, and watch them haters not give it up 'cause they're just not good enough.
Everything was happenin' so fast. It was like I blinked, sold 3 million
Kool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
Backpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
Christo-pher Reeves swimmin in my swim trunks
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name

Fucking fictitional characters and fariytales,
The coroner with a storage bin rented

Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
I get too blunted off of funny home grown, â€˜cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono (oh no!)
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it

As I got a little bit older, my hate
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,

Then I wonder why I stay famous
but why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other emcees?
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Then why the fuck am I yelling at air
Voices are leading me up to the attic. I love my house.
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the

Skip over the "huggy bear" and all the "kissy face", please
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
Eminem is heading skyward
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
For a gangster you sure did shit your pants
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
It just means so much more to so much more
It's too late to start over

Tired of not having a deal
If you could count the skeletons in my closet Under my bed and up under my faucet
If you could count the skeletons in my closet Under my bed and up under my faucet

Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
"Daddy, look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
I'm makin' up words, so you can understandable
Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always
And it's just
Superman ain't savin' shit
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her

Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, "Protect your neck"
(AH!) Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope?
I'm 'bout toâ€”
Remember me? ("I just don't give a fuck!")
But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
I treat the mic like the block, fought with my rocks an squeeze critics who expect me to under achieve
I cut my toes off and step on the receipt before I foot the bill
And in this corner, we have the mister
because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
Sometimes, you gotta come back down (It's all going to hell now, man)
Hollow tips is the lead, the .45 threw
Haters started to appreciate my art
I've come to release this info
Michael Jackson â€“ who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?

Bitch, come here!
You're acting foolish, this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in love with me John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
I'm so sorry! Susan please wake up!

If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
I'm Optimus, I make prime examples of mini-Tonkas
I guess a modern-day Jack The Ripper is all that I am.
Look at him hauling ass I think he left his wife
Hypnotic, product I got the antibiotic
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
But I can't even change the station
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (People)

(With what? Their car?)
It's just us, nobody else!
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither
So I can whip your fucking ass
Almost in a coma. Yeah, homie, come on dole 'em out.
Mysteriously disappear into thin air
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
{Screamin' out no regrets, yeah, no apologies, I ain't takin' shit back}
****** I did it from a mind of a mental patient
And I feel so isolated, nice I made it
Manslaughter goons under the moonlight
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me.
Keep makin' new shit
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
I don't do Jordans and Audemars
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters
Butt squeezin' it's the season
On my last rock, for my slingshot
But now those days are over
When we arrive we probably won't leave
When we arrive we probably won't leave
When we arrive we probably won't leave
The more time goes by, the more life happens
"Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"
Well, just know that I'm alright
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah I'm rich as a bitch
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
Yeah kick on back
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
"But I'm here to rebuild you."
Hands up, officer don't shoot
Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em
Good day and good night, Ortiz yo where the fuck you at?
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
Aftermath, still running hip-hop amazing
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Stood up and started to see stars
You're at the laboratory, storming
Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
I wanna get away from this place I do.
I wanna get away from this place I do.
I wanna get away from this place I do.
It'd be so empty without me
I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's neck like a Pixy Stix.
Trials and Tribulations
Everybody come on an
Everybody come on an
Bitch, I ball like a baby
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain baby
All I want is for us not to hurt
Get the fuck out of here
now here they come as we expected now we just set em' up
now here they come as we expected now we just set em' up
Cause it just died like "ooh, food coloring, duh"
Rollin' with at least three choppers, Ryan is that
While I shred MC's, like cheddar cheese
A game in this game, crush a motherfuckers free start,
C'mon! How fucked up is you?
The way she's grinding that pole
I could've been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
I break free like Chesimard
All I am simply is just an MC
The Dre to my Eminem
Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
It was never meant it was just an accident
You'll be coming out of Mommy's stomach soon
He swatted me with it, I'm cryin'
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
No regret, live by a cold June, no bot, y'all niggas won't be satisfied 'till I show ??, go out on the
Pussy, go pick your pussy leaves off your cunt tree, fuck you
To tarnish, whatever the legacy, love or respect
I'm off my fucking meds but I'm on an electric scooter
I just want you to be normal
I just want you to be normal
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
Gave these molecules to
1, 2, 3 (check, check) 1, 2, 3 (check, check) 1, 2, 3,
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
Don't get dragged to the auction
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause we need a little controversy
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
An erratic train of thought
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone, uh huh
I'm rapping I don't care what none of ya'll say, 
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
Never been served if memory serves
I need one 
Why you hitching at night?
Music into the picture and it became my new religion
And on a quiet night
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
Let me be the voice and your strength, and your choice
Puting it but I like staying
I hate the swings but I love being an underdog
Just smile back...
Just smile back...
Just smile back...
Now I never wanted someone to die so bad in my fuckin' life
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
Lie down fucker (baa), try countin' sheep
I'mma pull you to this bullet, and put it through you
NO
I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
What up Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (Facts)
Fix your musk, you'll just be another one bit the dust
that I had a baby sister
Same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding
All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
And created a sink hole, buried the stink hoe in it, then paid to have the street repaved (the fuck?)
We are not alike, there's not alike us
We are not alike, there's not alike us
to say what I like, and walk around flippin the bird
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole, better pack toilet paper
Let your hair down to the track
I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
This ain't a song it's a warning to Brooke, Hogan and David Cook
We as Samaritans
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback.
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
"Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black?"
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.
Now listen to me, while you're kissing her cheek

Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch.
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
I don't wanna go another round (but I won't)

You think I'm ugly, don't you?
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know help me! What the fuck's happening, I think I'm fucking melting
I'll bet you do
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
I just finished fuckin' a fish called Wanda
So bring the money by tonight - cause your wife 
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow, hand's on my head, touched knees to elbow
It become a problem. You're too pussy to tackle, get up.
It's they who legs I brake and make achy
An as a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me, that same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
It's a must I redeem my name 'n' haters get mushed.
"Daddy, it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding."
How I'm buryin' these artists
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'
'Cause it's too easy to see
'Cause it's too easy to see
'Cause it's too easy to see
'Cause it's too easy to see
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)

There's thunder.
'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
I'm tired of all you (of all you)...
I blow eighty holes in you
Who said he was better,
Like mic check, pimp for what it's worth I got the right knit, sittin' here excited by some shit that
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
We're on that ninth cloud, two insane lovebirds
Just for no reason other than the just to tease him
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you
Arrived back at my enemies' crib with Hennessy
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you
I got a million in cash
Collapse and crumble perhaps
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
Then...
"You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?
Your pussy lyric,
but however it works its insane
You don't think so, do you?
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone

Slim Shady, 2001
Slap hips, support domestic violence
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never
Who walk around depressed
With the root of all evil
For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my arse whipped
I'm a grown man!
My next whore's gonna have mechanical arms
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Catch fire, get upset and fire back
MC's you better consider this a formal warning
No one, no one is iller than me
No one, no one is iller than me
No one, no one is iller than me
No one, no one is iller than me
And I think my neck is breaking.
Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat
Quit crying, bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?
When it whirls, when it twirls
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out

And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
Girl you think that other prick's hot
So never say never cuz Shady Aftermath together
problems among young people today, is fungus
Rather have me (I know, but), we just in too deep
Rather have me (I know, but), we just in too deep

But you know you aint gonna do nuttin
Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
You're my Xanax and my valium, I'm an addict, you're a downer
Never took much to convince Dre
I'm taking it back."
The Eminem Show was fantastic
Mentally endangered; I can't stay away from a razor
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
You're tied up in the basement while I chill on your sofa
The sorcerer of intercourse - if it's forced, it's him 
But I think I got just the thing
Bottoms up on the pill bottle
But whatever this is, it's working
Formula 40-40 and 40s with bad capsules
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
I need to stop bein' debated
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt.
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
I pretend to work there, while I clean the floor
I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
What you usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?
That's all that matters for the time being
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party!
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party!

My baby mama's not dead (uh-uhh) she's still alive and bitchin (yup)

We just met and I just fucked you
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
I get to meet famous people look at her, dag
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
I think I got a generation brainwashed
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the don, I'm King Kong
Any opinions or somethin you just wanna get off your chest
Hi, my name is...
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
Me? Tear no shed
Behold the final chapter in the saga

Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery

But I think I might be buildin' up a tolerance to you
There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse

Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
The mortician of love sent from above.
I'm the miracle whip, a trickster
I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck

There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies and Proof

So suck my motherfuckin dickOkay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed,
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
You can't cut the mustard, What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
King Tee, UTFO and Schoolly D, PE and BDP
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

"I'm a heartless monster"
"I'm a heartless monster"
I'll run a truck through the weed house
She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice
YZ and Chi-Ali, Rakim and Eric B., they were like my therapy
No man would boldly go to this place

Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
I recommend you take your things and check them in
'Cause it's theâ€¦
I'm unstoppable
Wake up behind these trenches,
Wake up behind these trenches,

Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
You make me sick
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
I've got so much more to do
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
What you tryin' to be? My new wife?
No one could do it better
Always itchin' for something to do, was flipping
Often as I can and skim through all them bitches
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15

Honest and open talk to you
My candy paint's enough
He's taping me, he's biting me, he's laughing like it's funny"
It goes by the name of Eminem
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side.

She asked could I give her mine two

And you spit and people are feeling your shit.
You can hurt 'em
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a biggie and 'pac joke
And I hope your butt is hurt
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
That was never my object for someone to get killed
It's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve.
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin me and I couldn't breathe
The minute shit was heated she just bailed
And since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take 3 naps

Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Why are you being so mean?
if you think your the top and king of the castle
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
And there's a million of us just like me
so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
So many things different (things different)
Like I just left the damn concession stand (Yeah)
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
Got you feelin' me, whether willing or unwillingly
A kid who refused to respect adults
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
Dadâ€™s a little nervous, but at the same time excited
Cuz we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Oh but it feels so fucking good
I'm right in your ass (sodomy)
Overd-d-dose
Overd-d-dose
Overd-d-dose
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin some trees (HEY!)
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
Back better than ever,
So, I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurring
I'm so raw I still need to un-thaw
What do I gotta do to get through to you, to show you
But wear diapers cause you might leave a streak
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
Gotta roll me the ladder.
Then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)
To make a bad girl good
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
And not say what I got to say
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
wearing buku vests
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes,
Give me contact buzz 
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
Razor blades with me to make you bleed,
There's a concept that works
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Who stand inside of the booth truth spilling
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
Us as a citizen

Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What?
Maybe we took this too far

He's a problem child
Where there's flames, there's chronic
And I'll be in the back of your memory
Why you always need a lecture?
but I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
What's gotten into me?
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
And your childhood too
I'd never love you enough to trust you
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
In search of a chick who stacked them so thick
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)Eminem Has a full line of chainsaws
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again
This must be how bein' hoodrich feels
(Shittin on rappers) Causin hospital accidents
whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas
I could never turn my fucking back on youâ€”what is that?
For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
I was hopeless (Oh), now I'm focused (No)
'Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Leanin' out the window, going Keyser SÃ¶ze
C'mon
C'mon
If I ran who would I run to,
Spend a million a track and went over my budget (Ohh shit!)
On leaving this world this evening,
When shit is in the stores, cause you can be a star
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number
You're not dead! You're not dead!
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
But I'm not giving up 'til I get my respect, and I won't stop 'til I get enough,
Shady what are you doing chewing on a human,
Told you I'm so dirty, homie you can throw me in some holy water
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her?
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name is... "
Your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed
or was it a figment of
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Count down to Nuclear Meltdown
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
It gets no better than this
In the sun cause I donâ€™t tan, I burn, blood clot
Illiterate, illigitimate shit spitter
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Oye, yoy-yoy
America, and here's to where it all
No brake pads, no such thing as last
I don't know, it's just the way I am
All the hate, can't tell exactly where it stems from
Come on! Let's go! We're gonna make a porn!
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
That's why I ain't got no time, for these games and stupid tricks, or these bitches on my dick,
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
That's how much we have in common
That's how much we have in common
That's how much we have in common
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know (cause they know)
Iâ€™ve been a career asshole
But it shouldn't be difficult to explain
He just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what I'm saying?
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
Take your Nintendo and then skate
Bitch I'mma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
And as we go along
Starting to think we were made for each other
Spiraling, here I go, I`m outta control like no
For a fucking reason for it that ain't there
Keep the motor on then I'm leaving (I'll Shit On You!)
(I don't want it)
My shit donâ€™t stink, I dont think so
As I wait to be scooped up in that van
Prove that if you were half as nice
She said, "The fuck with that, where's my Louisville Slugger at?"
Blow up and be in a position
Out the trash can and zoom
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
Or you think water is pink
Though I'll probably be jumpin' across the stage
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
Now stomp your fuckin' feet 'til you get to squishing a hoe
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
It's lust, it's torturous
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
I spit out a line and rhymed "birthday" with "first place"
Like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
when motherfuckers hate your guts
Fuck shooting, I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases
Little engine gone, little engineYeah, yeah, I get it
Cut off his oxygen Slim snot gourgin
Paris Hilton home made pornos
Like California wishin' rain to pour
And I creep right through the front, see
You know, technically, I'm not even really supposed to be here right now,
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
I do explosions and Molotovs
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)...
Like something's about to happen
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
And after all is said and done
everything blow up and all you did was just grow
Hangin in the club, with my nephew Eminem
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Fuck that shit, cut the sack
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
Then combine 'em with Method Man and Redman
An tell him suck my dick, take a bow an leave with a sack full of amar cheese, I found it hard to believe
And I saw your headlights as I looked back
I screamed, "Owww! My appendix feels like they could burst!
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
And if you fall, I'll get you there
Examination of more car tunes than animation
(Where's Bizarre at?)
He ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time
I'm drawn in so I guess I'm a mess
Shi-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-it
Stop, don't, I don't mean don't stop
How could you let him sleep in our bed?
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie, when life's a drag
Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
Keep speaking my name, name, name
Keep speaking my name, name, name
Keep speaking my name, name, name
Keep speaking my name, name, name
Yeah, can't stop now.
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?
Drugs, you became a lot softer"
Oh dang I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag!
And then pull up at 5AM in the drive in a stretched white limo
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
You'll give 'em not even a statement
I don't see nobody else (I guess I keep talking to myself)
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I lose my mind and my temper
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?
Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped you
E.T.A. 10 minutes
It's arrivederci
To pull his dick from the dirt, and fuck the whole universe
Yeah buddy
To the light at the end of the tunnel
To the light at the end of the tunnel
To the light at the end of the tunnel
Yes he can, I just did faggot, now guess again
My vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin
I'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in The Source
I'mma be a fucking rapist in a Jason mask
That's when he popped up a number one
Used to put 50 on the layaway, now my closet 50 shades of grey
Came back like a boomerang on 'em
Testing one, two, um... twelve
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck I bet you he's fakin' it,

I'm blazing MCs, at the same time amazing MCs
In this corner: weighing 175 pounds,
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
I so started to rock fellow
What a wonderful day; I should go outside and play
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
His house is a broken home, there's no control, he just let's his emotions go...
My competition can't see me
Kick down Dakota Fannings front door while the whore is tanning
I have no life outside of that
Smokes a bag of his weed
And save me from myself and all this conflict
It's like they murdered your ass
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Smart aleck, goddammit
Now the strays flying all over the place
And I got an evil twin, so who the fuck do you think that 3rd and that 4th spot's for?
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio

Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads (Fuck you!)
I'm back on my fuck hoe's, with a whole new hatred for blondes
But I know at least he's heard it
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
Feels like I been down this road before.
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
You can't run from me, Kim
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
You drive me bonkers, Iâ€™m about to get my swerve on for sure
Fuck that shit

Living in this world without youTell me where to go, tell me what to do
You're found dead in your garage, with ten o'clock news coverage

To show you how much I adored you
But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
If at any should I go
What are friends?
To make a cast, beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
She stomped him, just 'cause he asked to put his hands
Ah Your finger just went in my ass
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thingWarning, this shit's gon be rated R, restricted
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
Next time? There won't be no next time!

To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby

Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
You're just like a little windbox
My dick is sore from fuckin', when I bust there's nothin' left
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split
Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
I'm fed up with being humble
And take a vacation to trip a broad
In Gotham when I'm gone
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
'Cause here we go, he's Jigga durra Jigga da chk Jigga

Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
Let him impress daddy that way
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post

Now I'm flippin' over the furniture, punchin' holes in the walls through
And colliding with an 80-year old lady with groceries
Shady's right back on your bitch ass
So you might wanna think it over twice (yeah)
All I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps of my dad
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna' jump your bones to the marrow

But you confirmed my low end theory though, should've known when I made it all the way to third base
She's got her jaw stuck, from sucking my dick. Aww, fuck.
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake

She on the orange pill
Driving around with a smashed front end
'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I think I swallowed a loofah
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Laughter, pain, it's insane,
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention

Would you capture it, or just let it slip?
The way you acting slice when I tear your back with knifes
Remember me? ("I have no remorse")
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
I've just vanished without a trace
(Evil rise)
I gave my vest to

All I do is rap
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed
in my house
Proof had a proposition
And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building

Some pocket change and a little integrity
Full of controversy

So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
Introducing the star of our show
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 
Bustin' in the air, with 30 bitches up in my bed
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy (since an addy)

I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Never quit, too persistent
Or one split second in time, forget everything
Layin' vocals two days in a row
To this day because all I ever did
In each other's shoes, at least
While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
You fags think it's all a game
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it
from Kurt Cobain's head, when he shot himself dead
Rubber-band man, yeah, he just snaps back
R. Kelly with a full bladder
They run around the house just like terrorists
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Since
I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds
But I don't give a shit I'm fine long as
Just fed up
I'm still a fucking jerk
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Fuck 'em all, tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again
And homie I'll never forget you, no
Pull in the garage while you screamin
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
Disrespect that life and I'm in gang mode (Grrr)
Come to think about it, his name was... it was you
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
"Shady, I know you're in there somewhere. Come here.
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
the doctor comes out lookin' like Dennis the Menace, and it's obvious to everyone in the lobby
And I didn't feel a thing,
And I didn't feel a thing,
And I didn't feel a thing,
And I didn't feel a thing,
And I didn't feel a thing,
And I didn't feel a thing,
There's a missing person, so what? He's
There's a missing person, so what? He's
There's a missing person, so what? He's
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
Wanted to be left alone in public. Excuse me
'Cause since '06 you flipped my fucking life, upside down
How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry I've been away so long
I'm sorry I've been away so long
I don't see us ever being together ever again
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
Saying you sick quit playing you prick don't nobody care
That's about as far as your buddy goes
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy
Let's get ready for some intense
Uhh, to the boogie-oogie-oogie
For this monster, this coward,
Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing
Like they did something to me personally
Jade, I'm missing your birthday
I'm not taking any chances
all these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
And stick a dick in your mouth
I'm high and you're bi
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothing to worry about
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothing to worry about
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothing to worry about
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothing to worry about
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothing to worry about
I scrutinize every word, memorize every line
So forget it,
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (Huh)
everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood, or mask
(But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it)
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
I'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
I said I smell something in the air that's making me high
And leave this rap game with a bad taste,
Yeah I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I yelled for mom (Mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot..
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
I guess I don't know my own strength
And for my last trick, lunge on back lash
You'd fuck the Earth
Wake up in the morning like
I just wanna know who's driving the black Mitsubishi
Why am I tucking you in?
I'll Shit On You!
Walked up Elm street with a fucking wiffle bat drew fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissor Hands too
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop."
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is....
I am finally realizing I need help.
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (the time is near)
Uh, summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming I'm a human
So kick ya shoes off in the foyer
Boom boom chuck, I hit yo' ass up!
Sittin' back watching Earth from my Space station
And I ain't even planning to call
And I ain't even planning to call
And I ain't even planning to call
And I ain't even planning to call
And I ain't even planning to call
Nick, you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
I thought, "I oughta drink his bath water that oughta be fun."
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
Like a skunk in heat
Because I put my faith in my little girls
Some of us don't get a second chance.
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
I almost look comatose.
Wanna heal you, yeah
You run me down and now your trying to apologize
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither
Still in my yard when I sculpted the culprit
Like its a natural reaction
That I'm battering all shatter and fall
So the silly little fans they were mislead
To burn the flag and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Right next to Darth Vader
I was too young to remember
That when I come up in this bitch, I want the fans jumping
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Put my key in the door and
Put my key in the door and
Put my key in the door and
Put my key in the door and
Put my key in the door and
Put my key in the door and
But I promise mama's gon' be alright
But I promise mama's gon' be alright
'Cause when I'm pushed
She 'bout to give up the dug out (Yeah)
When I'm with you, I'm a different person, yeah
And now it's my fault my fault
And now it's my fault my fault
And now it's my fault my fault
And now it's my fault my fault
And now it's my fault my fault
And now it's my fault my fault
And now it's my fault my fault
And now it's my fault my fault
Swallowing a Klonopin while I'm nodding in and out on the ottoman
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
More like a smart slob, part blob
'Cause you've been killed inside
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon.
Dilly-dallying 'round with the idea of ending the shit right here.
And I'm back with a tapeworm 
But don't come unless you come to battle,
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues
I don't, I don't got my self control, I hope that you running
We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through
Shit legends are made of
So crowd around, y'all, 'cause you may
I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
I got your bitch with her butt out
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
And you just want me for my money so I got you wrapped all in saran
Whoa!
Then I come back, still try to fade me
Then I come back, still try to fade me
A get your hands in the air, and get to clapping 'em
Partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
Of the first tour. The last tour he was still alive.
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
Put 'em all in a line
Look at your husband now!
Tap into thoughts
I make a mess, as the day progresses, angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
That style that you were rappin' with
That style that you were rappin' with
That style that you were rappin' with
'Cause that'd be totally wacked, you can't murder a show nobody's at
So let the river run
So let the river run
So let the river run
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
Ahh choo!
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wond-ering
Hands up for the grand finale
(Fack) (Last year can eat a dick!)
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
I'm in the fourth row, signin autographs at your show
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
Cant relax on this grind,
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
And blast that shit to kingdom come
And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again
I'm tryin' to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me
Practicing numerous rhythms
But what comes around goes around (around)
And everything I record is over your head like a boom mic
somebody please stop the patient, get the cops to mace him
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
(ooh-ooh)
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever manGood mornin
This couldn't be true, we can't be over
And everybody's lookin' at you. What you want me to do?
And I hit you in ya ?
On the beat who ever did it
Tango, what you think, ho?
Y'all used to be in my corner
Bust all over the wall paneling
Freaking the vocals so frantically
When a nigga blow up they gon' build statues of me
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
We get to beefing, aint no telling at what point it will stop,
'Cause when I speak, it's tongue in cheek
Yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link
Our world's on fire, but we don't care.
Our world's on fire, but we don't care.
Our world's on fire, but we don't care.
Our world's on fire, but we don't care.
This is what I wished for
Now I'm popping Vics, Percs and Methadone pills.
At a 'Stop the Violence' rally, I blast gats
Then you catch him flipping you off, with his pants down
Then buried him next to my dog
And I don't like how I see myself so I
You're so fucking gravy, Marshall, I should start calling you "au jus"
I guess it was never meant to be
And wiped my ass with his page in source (Here!)
she wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica
I can't rap anymore - I just murdered the alphabet
these pigs 'll get bit fooling with me
Then he said kill emcees
And crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him
Lesson one: Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Right For Me will change me rearrange my head to be
Hailie, what do you want to be when you grow up, baby?
So good that I'm so bad
So good that I'm so bad
So good that I'm so bad

All I ever felt was this
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Polluting the air waves a rebel
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds
There's nothing that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (that's right)
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word ...
beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
Ask about me, man, they be like, there go the candy man
There goes another lawsuit
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Whatever

Son grow up to be an under-a-fuckin'-chiever?
In that first marijuana tapeâ€”guess I got a chronic case (yeah)
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
Real talk, I don't got time to evict these clowns
Punk, but none of it's fucking with me. Prick, you really feeling that bullshit?
Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game
Head is clouded in a fallacy, but in reality
She said "No problemo", windows are dark tint
I'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
Collaborating attempting to take over the Earth
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I can't ignore them anymore, they're winning
Maybe this is God just sayin' we're responsible
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
Hang my suit up in the armoire
(What you say?)
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Estas de buenas que yo ya vendÃ­ mi pistola
And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape
I'ma keep it 100, like my speedometer's at
Tell her you need a place to stay
This time,
to basically say
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Before the guns stick to the clip
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Follow Bizarre's path ran through it
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ieGood evening! This is your fucking captain speaking

Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
'Cause the disassembled body
Will rub it in, every club your in, we'll have you
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
To get clicks, but, bitch, you just lit the fuse
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
So bear witness to some biblical shit
The mirror grows lips and it whispers, "Come nearer."
I wouldn't have you anyways, there have been ample
Slut, I'm talking to you, turn me back up
Throw a fucking lesbian into wet cement
Looking scamp as Hannibal stalking
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)

I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
It's this lyrical piranha
If you don't stop after they call you
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
The further you put it behind ya

You're goddamn right
It all started when my mother took my bike away
This isn't golf this is a blisterin' assault
Who finds him offensive
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
Lainnie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
With you I have zero strength
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Me so horny
In truth a nigga just really want me tied down
Rubbed my magic mushroom tat
Oh no there's probably none
Evidence? NOPE! Never leave a shred-of
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Then waste 'em
cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
Girl you know you're my world
Girl you know you're my world
Girl you know you're my world
Just hit me back, and let me know what's up"
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I'm leaving heaven (You know what? Maybe if I had had you)
To my bedroom, as I fled
The only message that I have to send
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
Like I reach my full potentialâ€“I peeked
Hurry hurry, step right up!
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
I think I was put here to annoy the world
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it
May hit the curb
So lost in the moments when you're in them
Now bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
You crackin' a joke? It's laughable
The bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull her
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fucking black cloud
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones

If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
Mace in your face bitch, cry now pussy

That was years ago
And drop dead, no more beef lingers
There ain't no stoppin' it (There ain't no stoppin' it)
Here to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Til I pull you out the fucking story book and stomp on ya,
Fate tethered us together like two felons
Smoke gray, ladies go mental
Who's gonna see the doctor first, we'll do a coin flip

Pick me up, broken tibias fibias yeah fix me up
I just want my face in a paper
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Be all you can be, 'cause once you make an instant hit
Wicked wizardry, like a sorcerer and no remorse for you
Well, I've never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
I'm cocked, locked and loaded
Got a strap made of iron,
So they feel
Hi there little boys and girls (FUCK YOU!)
Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
The shit I complain about
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
I told that bitch
I told that bitch
That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing
Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
But right now I'm on the inside
But God must've aligned stars for us
My adolescent years weren't shit 'till what I do now
Take some inventory
Don't know what the fuck I'd be doin' if it weren't rap
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
I don't even know if I can say the word "pee-pee", "pee"
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
Married to the game but she broke her vows
It's just that when I think of you, it makes me wanna
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
so
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it
Nothin' can stop and nothin' can change it
(I'm Slim Shady..) I'm Shady!!
(I'm Slim Shady..) I'm Shady!!
(I'm Slim Shady..) I'm Shady!!
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
cause this is how I am in real life (mm-hmm)
Try to pull each other's legs,
A felon
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
I have the money to have you killed by somebody who has nothing
Playtex, icebox
Playtex, icebox
Now rewind it!
It just whirls him in a frenzy
I was that door, you walked over to it
But I'll never say the L word again
And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it
I scream, but it's not aloud
(No!)
(No!)
(No!)
(No!)
(No!)
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fucking bitch to the curb
But thank you for staying April, I'mma make you learn
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name it's a game
How to do a freestyle as fly as me
You think it could be somethin I said? {*echoes*}
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
It ain't no one but us trash
It ain't no one but us trash
It ain't no one but us trash
Then I jetted to the weed house
And re-appear in hell with a can of gas, AND a match
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through
Q-Tip
Although today you may weep 'cause you're weakened
Ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
Ransom for JonBenÃ©t Ramsey, Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit
I just wanted to see if you're still listenin'
Laugh at every single joke I crack
Slap the journalists on their ass
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Shred these old letters I wrote
But fuck it, I'm on one
Love you girl, do you feel the same?
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead,
It's a fine, fine lineA lot of people ask me stupid fucking questions.
There is no escaping
Plus this stylist that you fucked
Cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
I'd like to thank Jimmy Iovine,
I can put you in a trance the way I dance,
Might as well put the knife away
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you,
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (Yeah)
If it wasn't for you
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe I'll love you one day
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
and everyone's telling me what I should do
Get your whole roof caved in, like reindeer hoofs
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Oh yeah, Obie Trice
I'm kickin' 'em out naked, and this the sympathy
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
That we call our President, for the present
Give me two mics; I write songs for me -- fuck what you like
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
You hope to God I don't explode, I gotta blow this spot up, though
Cases of Maybelline make-up laying on the table of weed
Trying not to be noticed 'cause I'm crying and sobbing
Ashes blowing in the air.
Ashes blowing in the air.
Ashes blowing in the air.
Ashes blowing in the air.
Cause he does not even know me
While he dips 'em in PF Chang's sauce
Conversation and Hennessy
But it's only 'cause you're

I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter
It's no secret, everybody knows
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old
But you lied again
You might see me walking a dead rottweiler dog
It's like we knew the instant
I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
Dappadon Cappa queen mixed in with Ca$his creams
Pull out your pass for whooping ass and flash it on 'em

How many records you expecting to sell
No love lost, no love found
I'm afraid if I close my eyes and I might see her.
Gimme good brain
That's not a stab at Michael
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase
Alright then I quit, god I give up
I'm nothing but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
That's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
Yeah, that ain't what they all say
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man
He struck it
Still crammin' the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
Parents had all got to likin' me now
Breakbeats and words
And you backpedal that is a cowardly act
Unless, of course, you were given the consent to join in
Like Elton John, 'cause I'm just a mean cocksucker
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
I must be allergic to failure 'cause every time I come close to it
I'd like to share a story, this is my story and can't nobody tell it for me
My signature sound when the tube of lipsticks surround

The swastika with your name carved in it
But Lindsay, please come back to seein' men

The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
I just want some face but this is no facial (Ooh)
But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped
Music, reality
And he ainâ€™t even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumblin
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
'Cause I literally feel like you could die if ever should I

They're only powerful when you got your back turned
But the only one who's looking down on
Somewhere down at the bottom right after AZ

Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
The shit is all redder, you deader and deader
And you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm
While snakes slither in the grass spineless
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw

"She's gonna die dude."
I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
I killed Superman, I killed Super--man

When she came up with a kick to the nuts twice, steel toe
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
With the lawnmower blowing your bagpipes from Baghdad
From a tantrum I was throwing
i pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay does
I'm lookin for a girl
I guess I had to, go to that place, to get to this one
Just get high until the kids get home from school homes relax
After that, It was straight to the 40 ouncers
But you're on it too
Neighbors called police on him
Who knows, at least that isn't up in the air
And at the same time, can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin green up
Neck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (Drip, drip, drip)
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
So he does a feature, decides to team up with N9na
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby!
Once again, his conscience comes into play
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
You can sound the alarm
You can sound the alarm
You can sound the alarm

Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Daddy's with you in your prayers
Came to party
I'm a caged demon, on stage screaming like Rage Against The Machine

Bitch had it, gave me a baby, we named it Machine Gun Kelly
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
And the rings you're wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em
'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
You fucked yourself so much
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me
But classic rock acid rap is the genre
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
Widely regarded highly, bite me, sweetheart, I'm slightly retarded
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
And let's go You are now smoking with the best (the best)
Shit the day that happens the world'll stop spinning
What have I done
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school
'Cause I'm so sick of being the truth I wish someone'd finally admit me
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
"Who's waking me so violently, and why's he on top of me?"
(Is he rich like me?) Ha ha
To burn and it's burning and I have returned
I'll choke the shit out of you little motherfuckin' midget
Bumping and grinding that pole

My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
Bite a rhyme and rip it off then stiffer and ache, whither and break
That's why you stick it out no matter what
Yeah... To my babies. Stay strong.

I bought Cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
Slappin teachers, and jacking off in front of my counselors

'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
more than it did them
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you
I'm a put it on my wee wee. Ooh, good answer!
And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy
I doubt that you're going to house sit in that outfit, and those skin-tight Levi's
And I want to (uh)
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
and y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it

How thangs turn around
Tired of JLB saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives"
Homie chill, listen, I swear
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
The seed is passing in dust
Man, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (Ooh)
You almost got me (Stop it, stop it)
You almost got me (Stop it, stop it)
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough, so keep playing it and stand next to the subs
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
Someone's in, the back of my damn house rummagin

But my grace and loose tooths
Help propel me to
Sixteen bars, this ain't enough to put some ink ta
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit

While you at work she's with some dude trying to get off?!
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Cause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
Now ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
As I fall deeper into a manic state
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never becomeA-yo!
Boom boom chuck, (It's the Re-Up!)

I'm gettin you back bully! Now once and for good."
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but
Decisions, decisions
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin.
If you ever meet him, greet him with a shake, see

But their spirits still live on till this day
No one is iller than me

This cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh hell nah
Enough oxi-cotton to send a fucking ox to rehab
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
I probably should, these problems are piling all at once
Crazy
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
Dismantlin' every candle
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've set
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts

Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
So you can lie to Hallie

All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost {Yeah}

Publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick
On top of the world when you're the only
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
Blow your brains on your opposite ear, and ask you how your brain sounds
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (Leg, I see)

In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
M.O.P. had me grimey and gritty
She was like, "What the heck was that?"
You're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me
My last Vic and a half
I'm not what you think, I appear to be fucked up
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
Climb the gate, and ring the bell, like "Hello, my love"
Anyone who was buzzing back then coulda got it
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me.
So baby, baby
and they can't stand it
So won't you twirl around, and do a whirl for me?
'Cause I know one day I'm gonna be theâ€”
A martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder?
Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
I never seen no chick like this
Shady's back
Aftermath is the stable
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 
Grew up quick (no) was raised right
I know these words are so nutty
I know these words are so nutty
I know these words are so nutty
More alive than I have been in my whole entire life
A thousand times in these rhymes
who got fired from UPS for tryin to send you a bomb
These motherfuckers are thinking I'm playing
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
So one last time, Mister Christopher Reeves
The sick Satan-worshippin'
I have no snare in my headphones. There you go
But we're in two different worlds and (Yeah)
One minute, they're mockin' Jay
Bitch gave me an extra life, like "Take this!"
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm theâ€”
But I came here to get on goose and tropicana
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
Wake up gay, make up with Ray (Hey!)
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
You're full of it; you were dissin' his CDs
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
It's a beautiful kind of pain
It's a beautiful kind of pain
It's a beautiful kind of pain
It's a beautiful kind of pain
It's a beautiful kind of pain
It's a beautiful kind of pain
It's a beautiful kind of pain
It's a beautiful kind of pain
'Cause when we die we know we're all going the same way
Sleeping pill addict
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Look at how shit has been
Look at how shit has been
Look at how shit has been
Look at how shit has been
Look at how shit has been
Look at how shit has been
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image I live it
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
It isn't them it's you you fuckin' baby
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
The shit is on, 'cause you went and pissed me off
This blonde fuck's reprehensible misconducts, never sensible
Jed Clampett, Fred Sanford and welfare, mentality helps to
Get outta my face, looking boy
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)
I won't even swallow solid food
But the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em'
I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say bon appetit
Nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
.. And that's my name
Since you're in love with your city so much
Snatch the keys from your hand
Like splatter paint
You know, if I had a chance to do it all over again (Oh, oh)
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
it's part of your obligation to fulfill
Gettin head in the bucket, marshmello
Echo (echo)... (Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle
And this was supposed to be my first single
And this was supposed to be my first single
Don't fall on my faith, oh (rrr!)
Now, tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
Famed to the point of imprisonment
We're going nowhere fast.
We're going nowhere fast.
We're going nowhere fast.
We're going nowhere fast.
Rejoice in the sound of my voice, bitch, you don't have a choice
I'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
Give up my dick for pussy, I'd be Jerry Mathers
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
'Cause we're just
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
I'm a long way away from where you are in skill
When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us
Things change every day
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
he'll need it more than me
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless
But, agree to disagree
Cause all this delusion got me seein' shit
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
It's almost noon
I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
"Cleaning Out My Closet" and all them other songs
Yeah it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Im the *bang* you aint fuckin sick
They be like, "You put the Thought on? Yikes"
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future
Whack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
But I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today
I think they want me to OD on codeine
'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom (My mom)
My mother reproduced like the Komodo Dragon
Made that final maneuver to 8 Mile and Hoover and somehow I saw my future is in this
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face?
Well fuck it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait
From the north, east and west, but when
Doing doing doing
What I do, I do at will
Get a grip, Marshall
Call me extra, extra terrestrial
When we rhyme with each other
All the flowers, and the candy,
So you ain't taking out shit
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
Expensive heels ya little fuckin' Ferris Wheel
'Cause I'm from Slaughterhouse (People), check yourself
'Cause I'm from Slaughterhouse (People), check yourself
'Cause I'm from Slaughterhouse (People), check yourself
Go ahead and bob to it
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
Never was a gangster, 'til I graduated to one
Burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
But I'm already wanted for sellin' keys
We will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet 
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawl space
This is so tough, I'm gettin' choked up
You're still a cunt
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
I feel amazing and I'm...
We can hit the telly when the fun stops
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
It's like Rick James is shooting up your house nigga!
Tell that psycho to stick a Tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
As we move toward a New World Order
Until I retire my jersey
With a bottle of Jack
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fuckin Bette Midler
Let me guide you through the smoke G
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
But I feel like a million bucks, Ladies won't you fill your cups?
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin to straight jump out
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
Prostitute just climb in the Humvee and lets ride
Haha, wake your mother fuckin asses up
You can rule the world, you can do anything
You can rule the world, you can do anything
You can rule the world, you can do anything
You can rule the world, you can do anything
As long as it ain't happened to him
Get your ass up for the doctor
Rest in Peace to DJ AM
Wavin' the gun around.
All we see is 'em beat charges
Whoever had strife
(Who's your daddy?) I don't know him, but I wonder
It's one for the money two for the fucking show
If this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
Bitch you don't fucking think I know that you suck dick dummy?
I'm cancerous so when I diss you wouldn't want to answer this
I'll be right back just chill baby please?
But I just can't be the guy everybody depends
And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
It's the same as I got in college (zero)
'Cause everybody knows
'Cause everybody knows
White girls
Oh yeah girl see baby
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
And flip them, don't expect no help
So tell Laura and her husband to back off
Water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo my soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
No, he's not around now how that sound to ya, jot it down
Life a bitch that'll fuck you if you let her
You must be out of your dang skulls
Racking their kegs up from Racking a bitch to
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
I put wives at risk with a knife like this (AHHH!!)
Circle jerk, touch my body
To all the people I've offended - yeah fuck you too!
To all the people I've offended - yeah fuck you too!
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
I am also the opposite of what you are like.
Just you and I!
Just you and I!

Just you and I!
Just you and I!
Just you and I!
Just you and I!
Just you and I!
Just you and I!
Just you and I!
Just you and I!
Just you and I!
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
If it contradicts how I'm livin' put a dick in your rear-end
Used to be the bad lieutenant with M-Illitant
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
Tightening around my throat,
Oh, LMFAO, no way, ho
Look at all the bullshit that goes on
With more holes than an Afghan
"Shady, what up?" What? Come on, man, I'm crappin'
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
She's in hot water, think I caught her cheating again
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit
Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
I believe if you ever leave me
Damn baby girl what's your name?
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah
A drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
Guess I'm gettin' my g-God dang Jigga on, eh?
Still with the Diggy-Diggy-Doc-Diggy-Diggy-Doc
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Bugging and weezing, I'm having trouble when breathing
There's no one else quite like my mom
Though I'd like to be the strangler
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
This vet is ahead of
From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake G's
See he's in a whole 'nother weight class
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
That we all must go through
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes and I plug my nose.
Everyone report to the dance floor
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
That dream was so much fun to chase
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
Frozen Manaquin, posted stiffer than a statue
I'm so stubborn, the government won't govern
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
Please come in, what was your name again?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer
I'm gonna die wealthy, boss of the game, what the fuck they goin' tell me, A-Town's own tre, Aftermath Shady
When you simply don't care if it's an
So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off
Girl, I'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
From revenue huh, cause you can be king
From revenue huh, cause you can be king
From revenue huh, cause you can be king

Yo, I can't sing but
But you gotta believe me to a degree,
Not even the same league as Jay-Z
Bitch I'mma kill you! You don't got the balls to beef
Girl howdy, how do you feel ma?
Away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows I forget
Ladies and gentleman, introducing the new and improved you know who
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
Feels like I'm underwater
(The kids!) But don't blame me when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
You gotta make some moves or something
Games behind your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
Bumping "Fuck Da Police" while I fed her Rally's
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Crossing 8 Mile into Warren, into hick territory
He ain't as mean as what they say
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
Only women that I love are my daughters, but sometimes I rhyme
From a Kid Rock Insane Clown Posse concert in mid October
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
It's probably the shrooms I'm on
Fuck the fee
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch
The hooker layer - motherfucker say your prayers
And there was no in-between
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch
Ready get set, let's go
From splitting your shit wide open, no stitches can save
But they ain't got proof,
Im bout to turn this fucking place to Beirut in a day
Like a new day has dawned on me.
It's brain damage..
It's brain damage..
It's brain damage..
They're gonna hear me
to buyin', I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory, like takin' hoe's money, but that's
As soon as we hit the do' power surges head to toe
I got my baby back
You think you killing them syllables. Quit playing. These beats ain't nothing to fool with.
Thunderstorm has passed ya
Ending your life to try to get you inside
And we're back, these days if you don't got the guts or the nuts to
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Look at shit through each other's eyes
Look at shit through each other's eyes
Look at shit through each other's eyes
Cut 'em, gut 'em and just keep to stuffin those girls
I love beef; I got you hoes duckin me
But wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remain the same
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I don't need you (don't hurt me)
I don't need you (don't hurt me)
And I'm tryna make it to the St. Andrew's door
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Bet you I come back twice as bad (uh)
unexplainable shit
UmMmMmm touch my body
UmMmMmm touch my body
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
I cunt hear it,
Better watch the fucking tone that you speak, feel like I'm in a zone
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha
Now this would be the part of the song
Now this would be the part of the song
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
When we're young
Will this step just be another misstep
I'm a sight to see, but you can see from the ring I'm wearing
I just got my one year sobriety coin chip
We ain't gon' never stop beefing I don't squash the beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefing I don't squash the beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefing I don't squash the beef
Girls don't buy him no clothes, He bought that ho some clothes!!
Get my back right
Give me the cue like I'm ScHoolboy
You must be taking to much (E...)
If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation
They keep on sayinâ€™ the same rappers are the best
About the only fact I agree on with Donald is that
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby-de-doo-wop (what?)
I'm getting mad love, I'm snuggling hugs
(Fuck my side chick!)
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
You're a hornet
Stand a chance at the dance without a bowtie, Shady Records re-introduced you niggas to multi, so
I'm running up on someone's lawn with guns drawn
Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
Could've been a 50 cent ring from out of a vending machine
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
Jay-Z, J as in Leno
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'mma make you wanna punch out some-fucking-one
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali Shuffle,
All you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore you're done
I want a new lifeHey yo, what's up man? Hey, yo you been here all day man
All I hear is, I'm best at this an I'm best at that,
No matter how many MC's I eat up
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special
Aw-a-aw-ch-a-aw
Do you guys hear us... hear us?I told ya'll motherfuckers I was coming back
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt.
Our fathers ain't want us
Ain't he raw? Yeah maniac, that's Shady dog
And try to get money out the drawer
You couldn't make a bulimic puke on a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
I will make no more mistakes,
I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against
Fame's startin' to give me an excuse
So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire
Cause one of us would have one up on the other,
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
Throw the match, set the past ablaze
In the pale moonlight Yo...
But the chick's so old
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
I love you guys man
I should've been blasted
This is my legacy, legacy
This is my legacy, legacy
This is my legacy, legacy
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
Everything, except his tank top and his training bra
X to the Z wants to square dance with me
Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Ay, this shit is hella hard, homie
I'm waitin' for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
We'd be doin' the same shit,
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs
I ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight
What I wanted was to be the one that they were scared of
To shop at K-Mart and it became art
'Cause I need an interventionist
We snuck it in 'cause the beer that they was serving here was only tap
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit 
Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I?
17 years later I'm as rude as Jude
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
The segregation is bein' told where I'm gonna go
you know what I'm saying? Cause I'm tired of being broke
And doped up off coke and smack
Flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes
We don't do drivebys, we park in front of houses and shoot
Guess who's back, back again
No more shiners, already too much time tokin' rappers
-T-E, 'cause MTV was so friendly to me
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself,
Still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
Stumbled back, recovered, back flipped
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
Somebody better child-proof it
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smoking crack?
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
I'm outta place
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
See me and you we almost had the same outcome heath
So floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Like a sprained ankle boy I ain't nothing to play with
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Been there, done that. Aw fuck it
Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on,
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
'Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
My dad's lost it
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
You'll be in the E-R, we are strapped with so much T-N-T
But if I could go back I'd at least reword it
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Search to crush a Milkbone
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
But I do know - I'm back now.
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
Face taped to a waste paper basket
Blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
"We ain't nothing but mammals.." Well, some of us cannibals
I still am a criminal
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful, and shady
for me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers
If I wanted to kill you, it would've already been done
bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Aww look at daddy's baby girl
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
As I'm peelin' off, all I'm thinking 'bout is
Too bad, thought we had a connect- no sense dwelling makes
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Then you floor the gas pedal
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
We were so bulletproof wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
and the truth is
I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints
And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
Don't give a fuck, white Pac, so much spunk
You just can't can ya, man I can't stand ya
You just can't can ya, man I can't stand ya
You just can't can ya, man I can't stand ya
Your soft I use fire to cool me off
Paper, I'd rather let you see how
Black girls
Bitch I'm amateur, fuck a pro career
The rest of my body's still bein operated on
You are the Kim to my Marshall
Child support, your father, he ain't sent the shit
You get no love
Oh my God
Watching ballers while they're flossing in their pathfinders
But the rest of you assholes can KISS MY ASS
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
Bullet with your name, sending it your way
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
The most meanest MC on this - on this Earth
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
Why I oughtta
Why I oughtta
Why I oughtta

Why I oughtta
Why I oughtta
Why I oughtta
Why I oughtta
Why I oughtta
Why I oughtta
Why I oughtta
Why I oughtta

Now I'm special? I didn't feel special when I was with you
That's why I'm tryna hold onto you for as long as I can
And I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
You gon' die a ball licker I've been diabolical
And all we are is
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
Just when I may have needed you most
Deal with life
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a (faggot), bitch
You ain't doin' shit that you should
Just go (AH-AH-AH-AH)
It's so appeasin'
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
thank my mom, bitch
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
And all I see is Paulie Malign now, she's slaughterhouse in a blouse
Maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
Doody, I see you
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
That's out
So please accept my apology I finally feel like I'm back to normal
The poster addict for post tramatic stress
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
And that's when it just happens
Like whatever they say has no bearing, it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
Guess who came through next, X-Clan debut
Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
I'm turning into a non-humble Don
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q
Either that or we'll be beefin free when 
In front of every reporter that I don't like
I do what I have to to win
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
Black out, Zach Galifianakis, gallons of Vodka
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit. But since when did this many
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
I'm cocking my head back like, "Ed Lover. C'mon son.
We might have loved each other too much
That's what I call blowing your mind
Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
Pull up in a van and hop out on a homeless man holding a sign saying,
I got a long uz', and I carry it all day
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
So some targets'll get the kill shot
With entity, dementedly meant to be infinite
Writing poems and songs, doin' the same in school
Writing poems and songs, doin' the same in school
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
His mouth piece for a Cadillac emblem
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Did better drugs and updated
Aiyyo... this song is for anyone... fuck it
So they're probably told you go with the flow
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone
We'll update en route
Boy, I told you boy, I'm a Soldier boy, I'm DeShaun,
I'm biting, I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
And all of this controversy circles me
And the fangs been out since then
Falling asleep with writer's block in the parking lot of McDonald's
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
Man, I never thought that I could ever be
Too close to the StairMaster
Like I just stepped on one
Butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
I get in beefs, my enemies die
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
You don't get another chance
Will I ever fall off? That day'll never come
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I don't owe you a motherfucking thing
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk
For these Grant's and Jackson's
In school I was so shy, timid
Couple of crushed lexapro broken up wit the capsule or paxil
Back's to wall
That's right, Slim shady (Yup) sway & tech
I came to stake my claim like a canine
Dr. Dre, 2010
I make fight music, for high school kids
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Mapping out my strategies to get rich huh
They say what we display, is symptomatic of attack behave
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
You run around defenseless.
You run around defenseless.
You run around defenseless.
Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
(I'm just sayin')
And I was thinkin' I was more in love than you was
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed him
HK to your chest plate cave
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
The beam that supports me
Look hey, we gotta make some hit records or something,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Checking you out, like the clerk, while he rings you up
'Cause I'm cutthroat to the utmost with it
Poo Poo Ca CaYeah
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Fuck a peace plan of citizen bystands
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Yo I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
When I sit in my room envisioning
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my fate
Once I get going, rain, thunder, it's storming
I done made quadrapalegics outta these non-rappin rejects
(W-W-When they get bit with theâ€”)
(W-W-When they get bit with theâ€”)
(W-W-When they get bit with theâ€”)
(W-W-When they get bit with theâ€”)
(W-W-When they get bit with theâ€”)
What's your sign?
This fucker was twelve and was six foot with a vicious hook
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
I put that music in your veins like a needle junkie
Hello? (Billy) Aiyyo what's up (we're comin to get you)
It's what we into, it's simple
Fuck yeah, light it up Cheech, come on Smoke me out, cuz
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot
When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back,
And the doctor's operating (What?)
She said "I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married
Shady's come to fill you up, if you a D or a C-cup
Fucking animal, cuckoo, bananas, fucking A B
And burns to ashes
Fuck Benzino! Fuck Ja Rule!
And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him"
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313...
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Woopsa-that-a-fucking-daisy
Blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prizm
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
Yeah, shout to everybody
The girl was just not the one suitable for him
I just couldâ€™nt seem to get back and recapture that magic
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre super dope beat maker two thousand and
I ain't never seen a butt like that
It made me feel amazing, navy seal of bravery
They call me classless I heard that
I grasp, you can't leave
I strangle you to death then I choke you again
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
So can you hear me coming
I've been patiently watching, this game pacing these hallways
Better back away from the front row, get launched
I'm ballin' out of control, girls know I'm loaded with dough
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it!
Until he jumps out of the fucking toilet when you're taking a pee.
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
Who may have never got to see our faces
'til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone
Blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
We'd be the perfect match, 'cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
("Shit!")
erra Oh Ah
erra Oh Ah
erra Oh Ah
erra Oh Ah
erra Oh Ah
erra Oh Ah
erra Oh Ah
erra Oh Ah
erra Oh Ah
But I wish it would stop, and let me off right now
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick and eat a dick
So when you see me, dressin up like a nerd on TV
I'm the hindsight to say, "I told you so!"
Yeah, you're awful, but you're mine
"All systems ready for take off, please, stand by"
Return of the whack sicko
I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do
And as long as I'm breathing I vow to smother and beat them
That means "suicide" homie, you'll never throw me
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster, yeah
Are you insane tryna talk over me in the car
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothing
I was a... afraid to make a single sound
I was a... afraid to make a single sound
I'll do whatever it takes
Or suits me beautifully
I have you feeling aight, I get you high as a kite
For you I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
Dear Mister I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
Yo, you might see me jogging, you might see me walking
Fake shit if I ever take shit, I eat shit
Claiming Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks)
Come on, little mama, you're hot enough to melt Rick's beat
But I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Above the law cause I don't agree with police either (Shit, me neither)
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
This world's screwed,
If you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain
From fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
Let me guide you"
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
What the fuck you keep on fucking with me for?
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
Started reading a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
Whip ass on ya, thats the last straw your hoping to draw,
I'm gone
Up on this mic, when we're on it (yeah!)
Up on this mic, when we're on it (yeah!)
Up on this mic, when we're on it (yeah!)
when they try to rush him and lost
For respect
'Cause I'm a criminal
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
Machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given the chance
Motherfucker I'm grown
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dick freshly
I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy (What?)
Inspired enough to one day grow up
I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D.
Just a note for target distance
No, faggot, I mean I can't maneuver from movement
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"You used to say that I'd never be nothing without you
50 cent, G-unit, Obie Trice, D-twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre
Begs the question though
On molly, had the audience sedated
Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
'Til the smoke clears out. Am I high? Perhaps

You cannot fill these shoes,
You cannot fill these shoes,
You cannot fill these shoes,
Word to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Think I'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Conversation and Hennessey
'Cause real tits are still fun
Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
we won

Same kicking and screaming, same crying and sobbing
up in the third grade, flippin the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
It was rumors but man, god damn, they flew
In my head, say it's still a dream
And I know how you jealous ones envy
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
I'm gonna meet you at the club we're gonna fuck these hoes up
You're so hard to resist, you knock my socks off
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
supposed to be my first single
And hi ho, hand me my shovel, I'm liable to dig my hole
You vouched, I will never forget that and
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Who the fuck I was now Ninja try to duck my slugs

We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Sir I have a question

We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Dirty Dozen wants to square dance with youI got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed

The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, "Chill
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, "Chill
OK, let's handle this small shit
They probably just now finally understand how to rob fully
Has no bearing on the bad news I'm bearing, whoa
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
Showing I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch
Welcome to Detroit where is you get that promotion
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
American meat
fucking punks
Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow)
You better kill me! I'mma be another rapper dead
You better kill me! I'mma be another rapper dead

Shake that ass for me,
32-inch rims, shit, I ain't even got no wheels
Who's king of this fucking English Lit?
Translation
Oh look, my notebook looks smoke-cooked
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
So southern ain't just part of my grammar
You never wanted someone so bad you're sweating
I'm strapped for battle sucka-duck, crawl out the back, it's a bar fight
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
You gon' fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
It's one of those kindaâ€”
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
You fuck other people, and I fuck other people,
And it don't quit oh
And it don't quit oh
And it don't quit oh
And it don't quit oh
The music is so loud, but it's almost as though
and, by the way, that
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school (Stay in school!)
Let the X destroy your spinal cord
Why didn't you respond yet?
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
Let's see how many of your men loyal
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
How could you
To plant the K-Y in; I'm gettin' accused by a whore
You just laugh and go heehee
Little engine gone
Now I'm shitting and pissing on everybody
Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick
Drivin' down Van Dyke
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go *blah
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays.
Whose moms probably would've never gave two squirts of piss,
Is it the bar I set?
I am the Derringer aimed at little Erica
You shoulda been watchin him - apparently you ain't parents
We should make a quick dip
Nothing's different to me, so what, it's easy to see
And I'd catch the battery charge, but
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast.
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
Bragging about how you shouted like a coward
Obie
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Now what's his name?
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
And you're my fix on the days when I'm broken
Pissy-drunk, throwing up in the urinal (YOU FUCKING HOMO!)
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night,
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
Time to Ri-Rick-Roll, up the en-endo
Time to Ri-Rick-Roll, up the en-endo
Time to Ri-Rick-Roll, up the en-endo
Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
Keep me grounded, that's why I never take full advantage of wealth
So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Makin' plaques outta they head like dead venison
I poured my heart out to you
So not a lot of good, i'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
(I can't stand white people!)
Pull my pants down and...
Bunch of dogs gonna tryna dry hump it
Without a dime and, now I'm diamond
Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is torturous
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate, hit me.
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
Blowing the head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?
No, but I seen the porno with Son Doobiest!
Don't touch what you can't grab
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit yo' hoe
You know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted
Paul Rosenburg, Tracy Mcnew
Like paper you write raps on, obnoxious
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
That brother you spoke of, it just wasn't as dope, was it?
Who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?
And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
And bottles breaking, mirrors also
'Cause you're mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear
Ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
Totally tubular sniffing glue through a tube in the studio
You don't like it? Suck a cock! Almost forgot
Like I miss the pass when I went long
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
A great dad, but a bad husband
A great dad, but a bad husband
It's startin' to defeat the purpose
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
They was like, "Gee I don't know, he might be!"
I'm so-so innovative, po-po went away, I roll over 'em and make bacon
My public adores me
I know what you want to hear
I even believe I had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chump-ions
Same song and dance
Same song and dance
Same song and dance
Same song and dance
Same song and dance
Same song and dance
Same song and dance
Same song and dance
Same song and dance
Same song and dance
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
No, hey look, you got fifteen cent?
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Bitches too! You ain't nothing but a girl to me
Bitches too! You ain't nothing but a girl to me
Bitches too! You ain't nothing but a girl to me
To put up with your shit (What?), I need a plumber line (Yeah)
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)
Nobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove
Simple misunderstandin' but just as I went to slam on the brakes, that's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Don't fuck with the triple beams
Three to the one from the one to the three
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (put that down)
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
And jump in the bath with her,
I hit a light pole, you skrt off
I speed write and my loose leaves my launch pad
And all you niggas hating, shut your mouths!
Nowhere to run, to run to now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
My eyes ain't clear
Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions
The way she moves she's like a belly-dancer
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
He's dying of boredom
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that I apologize
You won't ever see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
You barely heard a word as she choked
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
?? the media pitted me of a beef starter
And flew you and momma out to see me
No pistol in the seat
All I'm trying to say is get back, click-clack, blow
Or Lorena with a two penises
To spit liquor
Like a snowmanâ€”ground-up
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"
Down the street screaming
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
Every day and for some reason
Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
Couldn't do nothin' play it off "What you bumpin'?"
It's one of those kinda nights
Somehow it seems like when I lay me down to sleep I'm counting sheep
And when we ride!
And when we ride!
And when we ride!
And when we ride!
And when we ride!
And when we ride!
And when we ride!
And when we ride!
And when we ride!
And when we ride!
And when we ride!
And when we ride!
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
If it meant life or death
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
Any rhyme that I say can and will be used against you
Your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator, simulator of data, eliminator
You're my habit, it's like I found you in the cabinet
The weak or the strong, who got it goin on
The weak or the strong, who got it goin on

Zap and Eric Clapton shaft brings Abba crunk
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
"Who's that dude?"
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
And launch one at these Russians, and that's all
And if I fumble the verse, keep going
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowing through me
I can't believe it
I'm the thumb tack
I'm quick to murder ink with lead
Complete lack of responsibility
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Been flirtatious with death
He showed me how to cope with the stress
If you only knew how much I hated you
I wanna go down on you
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
When I pull 'em like sleigh rides
But as we grow as men
You niggas can scream, holler and curse
And should you ever see parenthood
How many verses I gotta murder to
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
I look like a freakin' wuss, a pussy this kid just took

Shoulder blade full of cedar chips

My life'd be so much better if you just
Like a barometric pressure switch
Fuck you, asshole, yeah, bite me
It was neither, I was buzzing but it wasn't what she thought

So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?
Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Brain damage..

Surfin' every channel until I find Hannah Montana
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
'Cause I ain't got no legs!
I say every day she be giving it up
I say every day she be giving it up
oochie walla walla um da dah da dah da but you gotta gotta
You should, pull over like a sweat-shirt with a hood
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
I'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs
Hailie'll whip your motherfuckin' ass
I got the rhymes bitch, I'll kick that shitHey what up man?
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
You and me were meant to be together my darling,
You and me were meant to be together my darling,
You and me were meant to be together my darling,
You and me were meant to be together my darling,
You and me were meant to be together my darling,
You and me were meant to be together my darling,
You and me were meant to be together my darling,
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
That we have empowered
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
December 1st, 1995, dear Hailie
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Fell off then splat, get up from that
"And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
I just thought about the aisle
From in this house it's quite bare, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And so that's the story when Bad meets Evil
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
They wanna talk shit, let em talk shit, cause they talk shit
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
But in the evening I gotta go.
But in the evening I gotta go.
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
He just started hittin' me harder
But sayin' I no longer got it
And she got hit now she's yelling
Zee you always supported me
From the heat
My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased
caressin' this bitch, plus i'm checking out them tit's, sippin' on that fine shit I ain't used
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown
Baby girl, I'm sorry
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, eh
So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)
This shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us
(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
took my tricycle and
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
This was meant for your listening pleasure
"What the fuck you whispering for?
Fat ass burgundy bags, classy shit, Jimmy Choos shoes
Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm strangling your windpipe for nothing
when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
S-superstar, girl, I'm ready for you mama!
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe
And I all I hear is pop tunes come on the rad-i-o
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
Didn't Ya? Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Wrong with her, hit the off-ramp, 'til I coasted to a goddamn halt, hit a fucking tree now here she comes at full speed she's racing at me, OK, you wanna fuck with me 'eh?
(Okay)
I act like shit don't phase me,
Who fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
My stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
I like the sound of that, yeah
We be great together
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
But you still throw yourself at me that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
Taking lives of firemen Say goodbye, here I am again Naked wives and vicadin 
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
And be calm or bring drama, a step beyond of Jeffrey Dahmer
"3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass"
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?!
I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
(You know what Dre? I don't like your attitude)
You're fucking corny. You try to turn your charm on
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb stone
How could I not blow? All I do is drop "F" bombs
And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful
Not ya everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Catch a contact, then I'm gone and I'm back
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
They won't budge
They won't budge
They won't budge
They won't budge
They won't budge
They won't budge
High off her love, drunk from her hate
Oh yeah don't think I won't go there
How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Can anybody hear me, yeah?
Can anybody hear me, yeah?
Can anybody hear me, yeah?
Can anybody hear me, yeah?
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaat
Make lemonade then
The world's not against you
All I know is when I get there
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
You showed me nothing but hate
You showed me nothing but hate
Then I said, I said
When I'm devising this rhyme
You're stuck with the same stick that your tryin' to light
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
Baby all I wanna do is swallow one and two
All they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
All they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
All they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
You say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpiring
Just the thought of dying alone that really irks me
I keep hearin voices like wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner
And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
But convince me you've heard
I hate to be bothered
You're pointless as Rapunzel
 Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake 
Then I can trap it, so no more time elapses through it
I'm just tryna unwind now I'm
Skibbedy-be-bop, a-Christopher Reeves
The weight has been lifted
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck sicked, mummy
to be at a all-time low.
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
A lot of people say misoginistic which is true
(*click* Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
To be a housewife who outright lies
And sink my teeth in 'em and fill 'em full of poison
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
I'm gonna cry...I'm crying
They talk about my daughters hopin' I fly off of the handle handle
I'm the kind of guy that's mild
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
I'm gonna fackin'cum
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I shoot the gift like I'm hollerin' "Die Santa!"
(I'll Shit On You!) I'll spit on you
No disrespect to technology
I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
Yeah baby, do that dance
Yeah baby, do that dance

Tell your momma I'ma drop you off at the hospital later
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me
I knock on Dakota's door. It's locked so I go to creep
The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect the women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech the United States Government has sworn to uphold
You were obviously oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you
Soft punk looking for some nookie or bosom
but if it comes our
Along with the small fry's and average half pinters
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
Natural high...i gotta focus,
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't rap is it?
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts of entertaining
No coming back from where I'm going
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin ass mom

'Bout to burst this tech, at somebody to reverse this debt
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window she's screamin' I body slam her on the cement until the concrete gave
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
I scream for police
So he's vague, so they mistake him for just bein' crazed
I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog
People just want to see
Get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver
Ignoring the shit how boring it gets
"Ouch!" What the fuck'd you hit me for?
Another motherfuckin' opportunity again
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
It's 'bout to be 2008
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
She's piling boxes in front of the door tryna block it
This is MC Proof
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I'm devastating more than ever demonstrating
Cold-hearted as Spiderman throwing a spider in the snow
But still, they keep on provoking me
I'm fuckin' stingy as hoes
Nah, Em, tell 'em to kiss my black ass, to clean parts, to shitty parts,
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom and make sure I got all of it
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
To make 'em feel the feeling that I'm feeling right this minute

Kiss my candy-painted ass

Fuckin' old-ass, ignorant, innocent-lookin' senior citizen
Press tight on the trigger of this Glock

I was wrong 'cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin you move
I said "I'm here to do sink repairs."
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

The sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite
Don't wanna see you,
Don't wanna see you,
I don't know
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
Tired of never having any ends
Roll up the car windows
Than quit bringing my flows, quit giving me my ammo
And don't try nothing funny
Taping bombs to the back of record companies
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
Stuck in the past iPod what the fuck is that?
Bad Meets Evil, what ('til next time)
kiss the crack on my cracker slashed ass
With a brand new CD for these fucking retards
The Great White American Hope, done hooked up
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Plus we lost Bugz, Slang Ton, and Freaky Tah
Ain't slowing it down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
Stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass
But I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
And this one begins where the last one ends.
What you wanna do, cocksuckers? We glock busters
Beat strangler attack
Yoda-loda-le-hee-hoo
I ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet (bitch!)
But I don't need it "Well fuck it then, break it up
Life's handing you lemons
Now I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin', someone better get this bitch,
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
I help them see they way through it, not you.
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him?
and Angelina Jolie is just another ho
I had a vasectomy Hector
Like this is how I'll cut your face up, bitches with these hedge trimmin' scissors with razor edges
And swallow the shell of the hollow who dwell
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
You wouldn't want to be
Cause he was was his biggest fan, he used to be Superman
Competitors fall at my waist
Patient cool pale and diaphoretic
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
He used to be like a hero to me
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Who's likely to become a serial killer, case of Tourettes
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
I'm up, Tuesday, it's morning
Pickin' them up and stuffin' them back
Cause true indeed if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it,
You know I can't stand to lose, Me and my goons are like animals
After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom,
"Wow up close didn't know you had crow's feet!"
Your boys are like, "She's fucking with dude. She wants him."
Copping over the opposition
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
You say that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Rip out the stick shift and
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet
If you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, duh-da-da-da-da
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
I second and third that
Never see you
But don't think I ever stopped to think that I was speaking to children
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
God, I'm gonna puke
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed,
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Sloppy Joe's, bulk waffles
You sadly mistaken if you thinking that I'm not on my game, boy.
Nah, turn the valium up!
Remember that
Remember that
we aint just talking to one person
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
I just rewind clocks.
Let me sing this shit soprano
Been ridin' for days, tour bus look like ryker's island
Oh shit, I almost forgot
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive, I'm on top again
Or sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' I run shit
You can be just like me
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
That eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
I've got something to prove to fans 'cause I feel like I've let em down

Looking for a couple bitches with some double Ds
And seventy (Yeah)(kill kill kill)
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singing this song to my daughter
I'da heard everything
'Cause I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blowing
I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
I was never the type of kid
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
With fucking cornrows
Self esteem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof 'cause trust me
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
While I sit there and wait and I marinate
THIS GUN IS LOADED!!!
But beef will at least cost you your career
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana, 
Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up
Only in Boston,
I go out and just come back full circle again
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
trust me
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
"Get off me, please! Get off me, stop!"
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
Marshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills?
You gon' have reason to hate me
You gon' have reason to hate me
You gon' have reason to hate me
You gon' have reason to hate me
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
Take this gun and cover me, Slater
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Maybe you like being shoved
with her second egg
(Don't leave me!)
Just me and you
Just me and you
Blood all over me, Dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Apple bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
I got a rap i ain't diein',
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith
Or let me be me so let me see
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS infested
I'm connected gettin' weight, from MS-13 with SK's, AR's an Mini-14's, I'm Ca$his, the last of
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
When I'm not cooperating
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Isn't that us on that poster?"
In the corner trying to seek solitude

Step on stage and you get socked and pushed
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her.
New plan Stan
Sick of nagging bosses bitching while I'm washing dishes
You from leapin' off the motherfreakin' deep end
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a
Shit I don't know
When I found her it was love at first encounter
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
While I get fellatio and give a facial to an interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
It was November 31st today, would've been our anniversary
I'm blind from smoke in 'em, with my windows tinted
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
And broken dreams
Awwright. Goddamn, this motherfucker gets on my fucking nerves
I can't tell you what it really is
Trippie Redd, with pills and lean
Good cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry,
That white-trash traffic in gridlock shit hoppin' like six blocks
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
Let her come to me, male sweater, some degree, fail
To feel like a spoiled carton of milk
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?
It feels strange but uh, I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like...
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again 
Who love booze and alternative music. What's up
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
And I aint looking back infact they can stare at my ass crack

Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
You're a trainwreck, I got a one-track mind and, shorty, you're fine but you sorta remind me of a 49'er
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go

(Hehe) You and what army could harm me?
Unless it's the middle finger, to finger you
They flung it across the table
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers.
But the longer we spend living this lie that we live
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes, uh.
That same dude you gave nothing, I made something doing
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin with bright lightning
And that's why...
Last night was a blast
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
last night when them assholes
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I'm from an era, you had beef? You prolly fist fought on sight
Broke down barriers of language and races
I been missing a screw like Bishop and Juice
I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice (uh-huh)
like ja's chain
Went spastic and fuckin' snapped
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?

It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging,
Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll Introduce ya
Back up, in the, heezy BAY-BAY

Turn like a flip page, Swifty look shitfaced
Last year didn't work out so well for me
Onslaught, comin and I'm packin in my lunch up
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead
She's just acting out with her inner child
why my mother still
Let's get it started (go ahead shake your butt)
To shit on your heads, I been on the bench
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Subliminal thoughts when I'm 'a stop sending
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (Get down, nigga)
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (Get down, nigga)
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (Get down, nigga)
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up. See, I ain't like you
Away from you, dear, fear none
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
What was that? Dial 9-1-1, someone's coming in from the back
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
Cause now you see nothing but me, and I don't see nothing but you
If I was to say something about Paul Wall,
Well fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
Is "Dad, I'm back at it again."
Fan of the LOX, bananas, manic, I'm going in shock
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches
Sleeping outside the door waiting in line
Where are you going? (Or maybe I should say, "Thank you")
Beyond just mentally stronger, memory monster
Still get along with this voice cause that's the monster
Go in, gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And the right one just won't come to my mind.
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through into time
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (yeah!)
Little cocker spaniel, fresh out of the damn zoo
Kim, Kim!
'Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
I wrote it on the Starter cap
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass man
I just miss you oh

I just miss you oh
And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
We don't give aâ€¦ no, no.
We don't give aâ€¦ no, no.
We don't give aâ€¦ no, no.
But how the hell am I
Cause I'm popular, but you know this ain't love
Maybe you need-ed me
Maybe you need-ed me
Maybe you need-ed me
Maybe you need-ed me
Maybe you need-ed me
You went there looking for me? Boo that excuse is too lame
Cause you love me, and I love you more.
knowing god damn well that I'm one of the best motherfucking rappers who ever lived period.
I'm busy, yeah, fuck these bitches, fuck 'em all, get money, Shady records, Obie Trice, Eminem,
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
Somebody tell these girls please release my undies
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Laying on the patio man, rolling a fat one,
Ironin' board a bench, a wrench, a ore, wench an attention whore
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow!
I'm in the back.
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail
I'll be the prisoner to flee, all of this misery
My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
How much in fear when u hear me you'll be
From a midget reaches out from under the car 
On every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,
Lord knows I was right 'cause you just crossed the line
Lord knows I was right 'cause you just crossed the line
Lord knows I was right 'cause you just crossed the line
There's no gun in hand
Here's a clue (hey),
Knows I'm about fast cars and alize, partying all day
And drop it off at the park that was the half-way mark
Then I buried the hatchet, I carried on my back 
A fuckin' romantic, I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch! Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
She was the girl the media always picked on
I tried to plead and tell him, "We shouldn't beef"
Tied 'em around my neck
K-Solo, Treach and G Rap
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
And I aint wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no nada,
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Fuck you gonna say to me? I'll leave on my own terms ass
There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (woo!)
I'll get up 'fore I get down
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was 'sleep
just to even listen to me
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage to crazy?
And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
'Cause that's just the way she was
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1 
Uh-oh! Now the whipped cream is out.
Yeah, baby hold me down.
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars
As an adult, amazing: back then I put anything
I like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was phat
Tic-tac-toe comes with six-pack with Exacto
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad, yeah, dad
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Oh shit bro, hold up, wait
You must be on the cock of Doc, cuz Doc left you all guessin'
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Who swallow lit roaches
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
I got Jonbenet Ramsey in my Ninety Eight Camry
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
You're dead wrong
You're dead wrong
The first victim I had, she was a big one
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
That's how we go, with time spent, emotion grows
deal back then
I'mma spark plug, I'm like the car with the cables hooked up to my fucking back, I'm a Duracell
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
Which should've been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff and just leave
So come get on this Kid's rock, Baw with da baw, dang-dang
Fuck you,
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
the only one up in that league, see
Last week this old man I had to blast
Some, I just barely nicked 'em
Was making me get cold, and began to get a chip shoulder
pigment of my skin
But go crazy on you
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em
If raps could do it, maybe I could tap into it
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
You think I give a fuck!
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
You know
I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick (SMACK)
Canada-bis, don't want no parts of me
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back"
It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
Two pistols on hip, both are gripped
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Payless, high-tops
Payless, high-tops
Animals havin sex with 'em; camels mammals and rabbits
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
I can't keep my lies straight
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
I don't think this typhoon's lettin' up any time soon, here I go
It's 3 A.M. and here I come so you should probably run
Probably comin' from the dope house
Scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets
Don't fall on my
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Pop star, icon, the whole works
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
I've written you five or six different times and
More than try talking you into coming up off of it
this shit is all day man its too easy
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz.
(You're right!)
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times in a tub
Black eyes on the movement
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
To offend as many people with this I can, simply because I can
Going through peaks and valleys,
And I probably ruined your parents' life
I'm not just talking awards, homie
Why we always at each other's throats?
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
Ripped a gaping hole in it
And when you throw the iron in it, I'm all that still
Discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen she's like
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes
It ainâ€™t nothinâ€™ in my way so I may aswell fly away
It ainâ€™t nothinâ€™ in my way so I may aswell fly away
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic
Especially when you can't even write a decent punchline even
Off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
A lot of people think that what I say on a record or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life or that I believe in it.
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
Hannibal Lecter into guy sex and I bet ya
Shove a fucking tonka truck up a little kids butthole,
Problem is neither one wants help,
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda
If this is true love,
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
It's what you're suffering from
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Why I'm married to you still? Man, I don't know
To feel like I'm going bonkers
Bite another line from Redman's song! 
3 felonies, 6 years of probation
Such an ass-whipping, okay
But Dre, all Shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
The only way to escape this mess and make the best of this situation, I guess
See children, drugs are bahhhd (c'mon)
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
You are just what the doc ordered
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Outdo Relapse
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
I still never ABC'D the shit
Stab me
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I stay heated, my people in the place need it
My pupils quadruple in size. Eyes are so bugged. I know.
Rolling in green
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse.
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
The most hated on out of all those who say
It's me
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And got drop kicked, now she screamin' "Stop it..."
Then you would know I've completely lost it Is he nuts? NO! He's insane!
Then you would know I've completely lost it Is he nuts? NO! He's insane!
-dee in this bitch; send a bomb to my moms lawyer
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
I've been making wedding plans all day
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
So start the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Come on let's go back
Come on let's go back
Come on let's go back
Candy-painted tint, shit's so dark
And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
Is you're one dimension
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
Son of Sam; bitch, I'm surgical
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
And don't worry about that Detox album
Come play, belly dance on me
That my disguise is pants, but they on fire
and smack the preacher while he's preachin
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
Into St. Andrew's Hall
I'mma own so many belts the only place they can hit me is below 'em
it's Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
Be an expert at computers?
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
Is that a girl?
From futons to Grey Poupon's
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit
Told him, "Reenact him, you go platinum!"
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam
I've had enough of the chatter.
About to explode all over the canvas
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
This is all your fault
My dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
Guess who's back?
Am I just jerkin the chain
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
The world is mine!All aboard, okay, next stop, my basementâ€¦ ha ha
Y'all are sitting ducks, I'm the only goose standing
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fuckin' on
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do
My life would be so much better, if you'd just drop dead
My life would be so much better, if you'd just drop dead
My life would be so much better, if you'd just drop dead
Get 'em back ungrateful dead
I just wanna hurt you, aim for the skanks
Testing attention please
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance ooh,
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Is makin' it seem worthless
Wait is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out
Stick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk
Screaming, "F that!" yeah super ill
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
Cutting and bruisin' the skin
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
And you forgot your written
OJ blade is a pencil (Yeah)
I was like 5, 6, and how come
To let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
Puddles are forming, I hear somebody's voice
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
Get it? Checking the 'male'?
You'll feel like MasterCard when I'm charging
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
What's in your head, in your head
What's in your head, in your head
What's in your head, in your head
What's in your head, in your head
What's in your head, in your head
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that.
Than you fuckin' four in the morning
'Cause you just think you're Bishop, the Don Juan.
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster
"Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffing ether
Sippin everything from white grain
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
But I already killed you!
What you hollering? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
Bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson
I won't leave no stone unturned
They just don't see my real side
Cause push keeps coming to that
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
'Cause you're so over 'em
And as I lay these vocals
Whos they for them to say TouchÂ©
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
just hit 'em with a little bit
so they gotta go try to find em a new Eminem
Gettin' in relationships like this?
Girl, shake that ass like a Donkey with Parkinson's
You can just keep making them tired old threats
From the cracks in the road that drove me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
'Cause when I look at me, I don't see what they see
I'd like you to remind yourself
I fell through the glass doors
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
I'm zonin off of one joint, stoppin a limo
We can not give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes
So if I said I never did drugs, that would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Throughout the days of our lives
Bring this competition and face this meanin' 
In the paper, the news everyday I am
In the paper, the news everyday I am
In the paper, the news everyday I am
In the paper, the news everyday I am
In the paper, the news everyday I am
In the paper, the news everyday I am
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Remember me? ("Chka-chka-Onyx!")
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday
But only when it freezes (fuck)
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
And have you shittin' socks bitch!
Take a look where you live
Take a look where you live
Take a look where you live
When I get on the mic I'mma snap
Yo Em
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
They tried ding-dong ditching shit
(else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn) 'til somebody finally took me in
Here's a dosage of the antidote now you give him some
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
"Yo, what the fuck we do?"
And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift beware of me
â€˜Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
Your tooth is rotten to the gum
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
You had all this time to think about it
I would squeeze and you'd laugh
I started to beg "No, please let go"
see, the thing about me
Made a living and a killing off it
Gave Hannibal Lecter a fucking nectarine sat him in a fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture
I'm not God-sent
Now and grab someone (one)
I just settled all my lawsuits
OK, yeah and I'm coo-coo, ay?
Saying they wasn't feeling me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"
Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers
Come to an *err and I'm just like (Oh Yeah)
But then I see my baby
But then I see my baby
Remember me? ("Nigga 'Bacdafucup'")
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
No wonder we're partners
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Into her, barbecue her or would you do to her
Don't make me wake this baby
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate 
rapper slash actor
And all I can think is howâ€”
I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts.
Now homie I say I run it (run it) cause I'm in control
What's in the cup, let me see that
Fuck no! Go for broke
Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in trouble!
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause
Soon as they do feelings change
I'm an emotional wreck, weak, everything over affects me
He said, "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse..."
Let's go!
Make ladies swoon, babyâ€”ooh, baby!â€”look at my sales,
Fucks like a porn star
Was king of the underground
and the rest of the
This time I'm predicting that this one will go emerald
And they gon' do whatever I says when I says it.
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
I lo-lo-lo-lo lesbian
What's the attraction, mama?
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
I had the new ones the Cool J, Ice Lamb suede too
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (Yeah)
I know you'll be good at it
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E.
And a noise is spread, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Here's what you say to someone you hate
You walk around and say
You walk around and say
You walk around and say
You walk around and say
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em
I'm turning back to a madman, can't take
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
Either I'm bobbin my head or I'm just standing there watching
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Play no games, say no names
With a sawblade in it to make my jailbreak
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
She said "Fuck off" and threw her liquor at me
They jerked me around so what's up now?
But then I got a little bit older
Neiman Marcus, bags of Vuitton and all
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
And education sucks, and every day's another
Sitting nude in my living room
Never mistreated you once
You know this ain't love, you know this ain't love (What is it then?)
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Well how's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Rubbin' it in, chucklin'
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
'Cause I obsess on everything in my mind small shit
Ah, somebody help!
To fuck with, bitch, quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids
What you expect her to do?
I, I, hate
I, I, hate
I, I, hate
I'll rip a tree out the ground
You're the kind of girl that I'd assault and rape
If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
And use my enemy's words as strength
Because they're gonna taste myâ€”
You probaly wish that you could be out shootin them G's
Yea faggot the steaks/stakes are high
My mom, I'm just like her
Girl where the rest of that promethazine at
Public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend. So, fuck it, I guess then...
My balls broke both of her collarbones (Oww!)
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
Whooo,
And it hurts. So, I fast forward. Sleepin' pills will make me feel alright.
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep 
Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
We rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
(whattup whattup whattup.. Outsidaz)
And kicked and hit with shit, every time I sung
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
New coupe? (Ooh) Been whippin' 'em
I was responsible for killing John Candy
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
and I know I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
And try to take shots at me (take shots at me)
And try to take shots at me (take shots at me)
Some shit thick as Mrs Buttersworth's syrup
Who expects nothin' less than R&B coming from that regime
My Superman costume
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
Givin' up, no comprende (Woo)
(fack, fack, fack) (fack last year)
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
So the route I went's self-empowerment
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
The Kuniva
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
And everything I come from
And everything I come from
And everything I come from
And everything I come from
Same as it ever was, yeah
You'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
Just heard that nurse say
My a cappella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
But it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
If I let you down, but this tore me in two
You was more so the chalant type, I chose
Tempt me, push me, pussies
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house, screwin' our brains out
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
and y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best
I thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it
I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit
It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Feel your pain, you feel mine
'Cause I had no supervision
I'mma be late for the pity party
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
Bitch cut my fuckin' brake line, stepped on them fuckers eight times, still goin' 73 thank
Other words don't try to put your heart in a headcase
Medic this headache's awful
Wait a minute, man! What the hell was that?
(East-syde!) Came a long way, to makin these songs play
It's the Mr. picked on Christopher Reeves
I say move a bitch move
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
You're Danica Patrick (yeah) word skag
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
More in love with me
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
In holy water no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
Oh, you thought it was over
Who's been on this trip with me
Now lets cuddle,
And having a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
But I run into them, running through the kitchen
You told me you hate me, you're gonna hate me more,
"Yo Slim",
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
Full of venom and rage
Tryna pick myself up where I started from
You the cross of a unicorn and The Unabomber
What the fuck you eat for lunch
And sweeties, thank you for waiting
Never seen no ass as large as yours
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
And regardless how life has turned out
As we pulled off to go our separate paths,
I'll pee on Rihanna
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Well it depends on how many you had?
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick (*slurping*}
on Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit (Limp Bizkit)
Smart ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
On the floor when I pop up on some Whack-A-Mole shit
Uh-huh
pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk.
You're gayer than you would ever claim to
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
That dress like a Lil Kim fox
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
(Let go of my hair.
Remember everybody used to bite Nickel
"No I was playin' possum.
I don't rap to get the women - fuck bitches 
Of my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
in a month, and it's yours, and you find out it isn't cause this bitch has been visitin' someone
I went down for the count, I fell but the fans caught me and now
You just want all my money, ah
Oh, look, here comes Marshall! He's on your street!
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
I told you I ain't fooling from the gate, this ain't the first day of April!
You done called every woman a slut, but you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin)
My ass from a hole in the ground, still canâ€™t tell em a-part
Chillen, cold as hell
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
I'm not yellin', you're yellin'
Surrendered my weapon to cops
Now everybody's so happy and proud
Just say goodbye to Hollywood
Through worse and through better health
Through worse and through better health
Through worse and through better health
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
Used to get jumped for my ProWings
My name is MarshI don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be
'Til I'm slain 'cause of some fag's infatuation
If I could swallow a bottle of tylenol I would, and end it for good
I just wanted to fit in
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
Top it off I'm on mushrooms so fuck all of you
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's, it's true)
And just today I looked at your picture, almost if to say
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
Believe me I'm leaving a carcass today
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
When I mix my corn with my fuckin' mashed
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster!
But I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Still follows me around but it's time to exorcise these demons
And you aint gotta tell me notinâ€™ boy, get off of my nuts
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive

Weenier smoothered in peanut butter putting on a tube of ya eye shadow and man it look nice,
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew (sic), knit wit
Fuck top 5, bitch, I'm top 4
I get bold like bowling balls
Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
All I hear is gunshots
All I hear is gunshots
All I hear is gunshots
All I hear is gunshots
All I hear is gunshots
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Keanu Reeves. Speed of life.
I'm sorry!
It only made me what I am today, see
So I am non-compliant at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
With his windows down and his system up
Thanks for being patient
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Or whether death's what our ending will be
I'm not afraid to pull aâ€”
Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to die hard
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
My back has been broke, and I can still walk
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
Yeah, but we're so insane â€˜bout each other
When his fangs come out
Back again
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
I'll say it all for you
yeah right
But I don't care, I barely can wait
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Scoundrel hound with a mouth full of Alpo
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death (Ah!! Ah!)
I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house
Instead of a letter
building shootin' at police, some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me, I'm gonna walkin' obituary,
To be truthful, I wouldn't know what to do if I lose you
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
While the politicians that are white and privileged ask how is this different from segragation, that's funny bro
We...
I'm a criminal
I'm a criminal
I'm a criminal
I'm a criminal
And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Laying here with her again
I tuck two Nina's under my jeans either side of my penis
And quit your...
What am I saying? Shoot em both Grady, where's your gun at?"This could never work," is what we said at first
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Day before you went to jail and daily
No friend of Bush
Like a fuckin' cocked semi-Glock demi-god
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
I don't want to hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
Setup by these white blue collared hicks
Further away it drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
'Cause a woman broke my he-art I say he-art
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't.
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack 
They threw me out the Ramada Inn
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
I just let the poker chips fall but they were supposed to fit
For all the drugs that I've done - yo I'm still gon' do
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just choose
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I said fuck it and lost my patience
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
Nothin' boosts me more
Well shorty I'm that man
Some are just stored in my memory
Like there's nothing that's more important
Custom everything, what's that on the seat?
I brought something home to quiet the stomach rumblings
To get their hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
he probably gone send a task
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)...
(am I a blood or a crip?) wakin up the next day in breathin machines
(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)
It'll be like my skin being Indian burned
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
Bending over backwards for these slackers
Fuck with gangsta fill pot, get your grill shot
there's a doberman pincher and a pitbull in the seat
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)
'Cause now with her in the womb
My ex girl, she just declared war
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's "fuck what they say"
Guess what?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
I managed to dwell
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
I feel like the greatest
I feel like the greatest
I feel like the greatest
Shit I just do this for the haters, I don't need the money
Now I got my pot to piss in
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim
Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
Every rhyme I say, sons you like an ultra violet ray
Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's so organic
And lay with 18 guys naked and let myself show, let myself show
{this shit is not for me},
I went in headfirst
I'm asleep in the front seat
Lines are like mom's CAT scans
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically
And you can't see the bitchâ€™s hair is frizzing
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here?? (huh?)
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is fulla' saliva
Code-name Titanium Temple
But sometimes it's like dropping' an anvil on a house of cards
But ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blond
In plane crashes and laughs
You part ways, your impression of him changed
I'm watching you rap, I'm the dude following in back
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
So ready, set, aim and fire
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
I walk on water
I walk on water
I walk on water
I walk on water
I walk on water
I walk on water
I walk on water
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
haha
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this,
Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
But I'm actually weirder than you think
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
I just wanna be your secret lover, yeah
To open gifts
So bad they should put his ass in prison
I put on my mother's make-up, get naked and run around
Donâ€™t laugh, please listen
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
If you ever need anything, just ASK
If you ever need anything, just ASK
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that evil grin (evil twin)
Please come back, to me
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (get it?)
It controls you both
And are you menstruating baby, my little friend's waiting to say "hello"
And if they mention us
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now
It's fuckin' crazy
You're just plain old Marshall to me"
22 jerks and a jerk circle
Not so fast
Oh don't do that
First time since you left and left me with nothing but shattered dreams
Aww shit, yeah
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
Cause we came here to set this party off right
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it
These shoulders hold up so much
These shoulders hold up so much
These shoulders hold up so much
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Like them buffalo soldiers, I told ya I'm bout' to blow
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze
but I was just so eager
Percent of what I rapped about
We can make accusations, people spread rumors,
I'm to busy fucking, your 12 year old baby sitter
I shout the slang, simple as A,B,C's
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...
I smell blood, I don't give a fuck: keep giving them hell
This whole world is a mess,
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin
Fuck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
If y'all against talk and reparation then I'm not against the thought of separation
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
Till I, sit in the dark and I reflect
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
From these activists when they raggin',
Does a word search get circles wrapped around it like you do when I come through?
Them women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
And why? I just don't know...
And why? I just don't know...
You wouldn't screw up,
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
And I'm singing...
Right behind you, in your nightmares,
Too many mental problems got me snorting coke and smoking weed again
Aight, well I brought some friends with me too
To deuce juice
I'm in a whole different league on my mothafuckin' own, it's just me
I'm a ten, you're an eight, like what I do before, after, and during rape
I'd be lying if I said I ain't hit
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.
So close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it
What now nigga what now what
and I don't mean to gloat
and I don't mean to gloat
there's a couple of cops hot on my trail
I just thought the shit'd be different
Much fun off a half pint of the Jack
And found a way to fuck it up again
I said...
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
My basal ganglia's an A to the K
This is more than I ever could of asked
You little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make
I wasn't trying to turn this into something major
And maybe that's what made us do what
You happy now? Look here
Keep 'em guessin' hard while broads say my bars is like ASMR
That's why I'm so clingy every girl I've ever had either says
Just be bygones
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
Screaming the wood off the panelling
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
A chronic abuser, not only user of marijuana
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
You went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out
Remember me? ("Step in, execution")
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
Can you hear that?
You had to put it out yourself like Highland Park, no fire department
Got drunk then I finished him
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I usually get it in bulk
Forget them other men, girl pay them little attention
(Oh my God! Oh my God!) I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings
So there it is (there it is)
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
I love all of you men
So I'll be disguised in it
These are shoes that you can't fill
Shit-stained drawers
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
My demeanor thirty years my senior
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
Slut poke holes in ya shirt, jump in mud puddles,
I'm fuckin' with strict stacks, I'm kickin' you stripped fats,
We the reason for the season so I'm just breezin' through the track, nigga
Ay yo
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got,
It's sick, but who could ever predict,
Cause I don't know what to eat, fucking microphone or the beat
Ooh ya' girl run that game
You'd probably crap in your pants,
Kryptonite: The Green Chronic
Pain meds, cyclops
Pain meds, cyclops
Now this is our final hour
It's simple as the alphabet
Ain't bein' conceited
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach
So it's not a straight line no more
Inebriated, till my stress is eleviated
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
With the soul of a Sharman
So see if the squirrels want any - it's bad for you 
can turn into some pap-pap shit
How's it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it? You neglected me
Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be fooled
Like a terrible towel
When it comes to love you're just as blinded
Bar exam, start of insanity
I'm startin' to live like a recluse
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
Cause what you say is what you say
Cause what you say is what you say

Hpnotic, Hennessey, a couple shots of Patron
Without no closure
Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
If we all band together, there ain't no stopping this shit
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her health
But if I had a million dollars
But if I had a million dollars
The hand'll wait for the fist to fly off to put this guy in a pine box
And my nose is pointy
Just isn't how I envisioned it
That just seems to come full circle
Blood curdling your gurgling on your blood,
Or the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone...
'Cause it's
Shit
She panics and he gets his throat cut
Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy, 'cause
Parents screamin': "Son, go in and call the police
Even DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot
Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a nick before

It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, 
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Still got a just a few of us left, but it'd be unjust to rob us our just due
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late."
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler
Cause I think I started hallucinating
Please say you won't tell nobody
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
Enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors
This eighty Gs a week to say the same things tweece!
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
You dealing with a few true villains
Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin Beastie Boy {*wolf whistle*}
Been this way since I've stood a foot tall
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Yeah, I never in the club met a woman worth knowin'
Remember me? ("I'm low down and I'm shifty!")

I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom
Feistier then a triceritops and like a dice player
Im'a be the wrong one
But I got your mom deep-throating

Don't hurt me
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
Doe, rae, me, but we don't sing, motherfuckers
Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
And boy, they did flock, can't believe this little hick locked
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
I should just live in a nut house
I'm in outer space
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
And get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M
And every time you think you've gotten past it
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Fuck you too, woo!
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
I'm mopping the floors with 'em
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
These rappers are like Hunger Games
I'm Mister Bright Side, glass is half-full
Sideswipe her, Dodge Vipe-her
If you've got it and you do not acknowledge it
You think "Damn!" when you slam into the wall
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
A place called prison and a place called jail
A place called prison and a place called jail
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs
But I get by with my wicked ways
This is my house, this place is mine
so the rats can't chew through his last pants
Tall girls
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
Been, on the hunt again; when, will it ever end?
My mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
Now she's upstairs crying out her eyeballs
All right, fuck y'all then

'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag
And you're such a fuckin' babe

Man you seen it all before you're all too familiar with it
Would you feel sorrow, or show love? Or would it matter?
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the Mac
I'm going back!
Hope it ain't "here we go, yo" 'cause my head already goes to worst-case scenario, though in the first place
Fuck doing what you're told.
Fuck doing what you're told.
I said fack
Who'da known?
When I start attacking your squadron
Do anything individually, which is to cling on, scared to be alone
These are the results of a thousand electric volts
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath
You on your last burrito!
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Right there's the coroner
'Cause we could never be each other's everythings, you got a wedding ring
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
Now everyone report to the dance floor

Now this will probably be the most illest shit that I've ever said
How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement
I think we better go check on their temperatures I give them the thermometer 
Lookin' out, 'cause
There she is on the ground being trampled
You critics come pay to me a visit
So long, 'til then I drop the fucking bombs
or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zy automatically
And there ain't shit I can do about it
Abraâ€”I go ham for dead presidents
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
You know why?
The thoughts I produce are loony tunes
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feeling braver
So don't compare me to them other bums over there
You see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze
I shouted "Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!"
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in, son
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
Damn shorty, I told you this was bound to happen
Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
I just put a bullshit hook in between two long-ass verses if you mistook this for a song, look
I'm wrapping up all the presents
Now I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
When we can't wear stars and stripes 'cause
I can't live like this for the rest of my life man,
I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac shit
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
everybody in the whole Shady staff

I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em

They can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once yeah
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
'Cause you put it up in the sky
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
You don't think he's strange, you turn around and tell him "peace and thanks"
And I'mma still be humble when I scream, "Fuck you!"
And I'mma still be humble when I scream, "Fuck you!"
And I'mma still be humble when I scream, "Fuck you!"
And then tried to erase and record over it
And I miss you oh
And I miss you oh

From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
But tomorrow today's going down in flames
Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve
That's what it's like when the mic is out
One tough act to follow
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
Like a murder weapon, I'mma conceal you
You slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake
Like Em and the Doctor with no guilty conscience
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
I'm sick of talkin' 'bout these tattoos cartoon did
And record the pig's oink, when I rip his intestine
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe,
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause
I'm leaving heaven (Fuck you, bitch)
Bitch, your soul I'mma try to take
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
When I be it, I be it, shit, anything goes
The few that I trust, thems the people that I still got
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
I felt the evilness and started transforming (RARRRR!)
He has no fortune and wealth
Think about her every day. We just could never get it together.
My mind's as lost as yours

Using his music to steer it sharing his views and his merits

It's like a monopoly
Crazy-gluing Madonna

Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippits
ROLL UP!
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in
But then it wasn't after we knew
And last but not least, one of the most humungous
So I'm gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'mma do it to death
But in my head there's something
Man, I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch
Yeah soul intent, checking it number one baby this week
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do

Now I got the Industry pissy
Outside, I look like I'm calm
I'm Dre from back in the day from NWA from black and the gray from 
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
I've been down, kicked
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
What's bad is good
What's bad is good
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
And destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
Think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
Life it will strangle you with bicycle chain
the ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
And pull you apart from both angles
While you're at band camp thinkin' that crap can't happen
You're addictive as they get
I bet you they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
Stringer Bell boy, my name rings bells for itself,
Just lose it
Just lose it
Just lose it
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
We can spit it for ya advance
Since day one, Hellraiser with twin blades of a sensei
We do it for us, it's lust,
I'd rather share ya than to not have you at all
Instinctive nature, to bring the anguish (yeah) to the English language
Claiming you a murderer, and you spelled it wrong
And "life's been good to me so far"
And "life's been good to me so far"
cause I'm bad for you
so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
Talk of New York, Tony YayoTay Keith, fuck these niggas up!

On the cable channel
You better go get your mace 'cause Shady said so
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
Take us right through the doors
Take us right through the doors
Take us right through the doors
Life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
We've both been,
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
Now have a blessed day..." Bitch, you serious?
And my daughter's down to her last diaper
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Guess I eventually caved though, 'cause she's layin' next to me in bed
I shake in convulsions, separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest
Like it was before my life became a movie
OK there's a bright side a day that I might slide
under my Sean Johns
But you keep treating me like a staircase it's time to fucking step
Without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at

And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
I got up I'm back to punch you to the ground, you trick,
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
The most foulish childish things without even blinking
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that
Should hit the kick and the snare
(Fack) How do I say this? 
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Someone ever moved them from me? That you coulda bet your asses
OK... let's go
That they say as a writer might've fell off
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
Too fly, I don't plan to ever Cinderella Man
But, somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
N.W.A and Eazy-E, and D-R-E was like my GPS
(Out what) it's either lust, or a cloud of dust, judgment is clouded must
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
You're mashin' to it, moshing until you're black and bluish
they're probably gonna think that I'm coming off as cocky (haha)
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
It's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
It's like the walls are closin' in
And in the front drive talking to myself
Obie the person that came up introverted
Obie the person that came up introverted
A stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors tactical practical jokes, yeah
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
It's up to you the decision is yours
Thinking 'bout you
She don't need to see what I'm about to do
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
No one's ever indicted you
And, little bro, keep making me proud
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Once you done, swapped your name with him
Hands around his scrotum, tucking his fucking penis between his legs
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
They said they found me on the bathroom floor... Damn
I have evolved into the lost diaries of the mob and the Rothschilds
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
She said "Come in, its unlocked!"
Than make another motherfucking "We Made You", uh
Forced entry. The more wenchy the more stingy I become.
(Yo', I want everybody to listen to the words of this song) or so we're told...
I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze
At cops and cops madder
You dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
I begin to spitting like vintage Pac, demented
And gee who better to talk to than you?
It seems to be the reoccurring main theme
Fuck around and you'll get annihilated
You should've seen it mother,
But the shit's about to go sideways, I just know it
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
Anybody step into my path is fuckin feelin it!
Hannah Montanna prepare to elope from a can opener and be cut open like a cantaloupe and canopy beds
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Gruesome, and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
There's really nothin' else to say I, I can't explain it
There's really nothin' else to say I, I can't explain it
There's really nothin' else to say I, I can't explain it
With a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
After such a nasty break up
You and your husband have a fight
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it
That's eight million miles in the sky
Afraid I'd never be found (my dream)
Afraid I'd never be found (my dream)
You'd probably want me to take
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Head spinnin' like Invisibl Skratch Piklz
I ever left it to Beaver
Everything, and follow me
I'll put you in your place (yeah) like a realtor, boy
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
I done seen how fast this rap shit
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
While the demons comin' out of me
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
of a fictitious little
I've been with 10 women who got HIV
A punk'll jump up to get him a beat down
In the Shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth, the difference between me an you, I already done an
You could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah
But this depression ain't taking me hostage
Like life's beginning, so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it
True it's chaotic, but it's got your body moving as a unit
Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
But the way it felt for me to be on top when I was on you
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do.
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Why don't I bring my fucking bat and just swing byYeah, trying to figure out the difference
Then I guess I'll dig her fetus out
And you must hate me
'Cause I got a huge mansion
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
I'll destroy ya boy, fuck around and blow ya to sod
I'm over here Sue, hi, you're talking to the plant, look!

Makes you want to get up and start dancing
Slit the wrist of little sis
Here come the kill joys,
If you're lucky, I'll let you hug me, but that's all you get
Teen million people, all equal at this high pitch
(Let's see if this ever happened to you)
Just to get close enough to study us
Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle, by the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Yeah, I'm trying to be a millionare man, hahaha, but don't all you know
Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo
She came at me at full speed, nothing could stop her
Knives, strangling wives with thick lasso
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell

Feel my wrath of attack
If you weren't so defensive
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
So put my tape back on the rack
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
Still in love with the motherfucking chick there's at least a million of

So much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's

As pressure increases like khakis
What happened, doc? I passed out again
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Livin' Dead
Then they anus'll ooze
All I know is I'm wallowin', self-loathing and hollow
Chilling you play your position
Maybe that's why I come back
So take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
Just to party all the way to Sunday
You've been trash
You're drooling, you have tooth decay
And that's why, my love, you never live without
I used to have hood dreams
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (haha)
Like Kaepernick, I got n-n-kneel, word to Goodwill-will
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
I'm in the picture
We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,
Bye bye!
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket
But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Command it, and I'mma be the boss of you now goddammit

"Sugar Ray" Leonard wouldn't sugar-coat a fucking booger though
I'm like a sleeping giant,
And dump on you if you ain't Joyner
Every day I hate you more and more
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
Dress up like I.C.P and have them come see you perform live
and codeine and goddammit, you little motherfucker
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bedsheet and the comforter
If you feel you're in violation
Eat you pussies like cunnilingus (Like cunnilingus)
Another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)

I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history.
Fuckin' great, man
My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm bout to be a father

And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
If you dames want him
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
But take a look at Mariah
Roll up with your (gang!) you're gon' need a arsenal
Leap tall hoes in a single bound

I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay

So basically, you ate off Hitler!
Ya'll been here every weekend man, 
So I spiral downwardly 'cause I'm too cowardly to leave you
I'm posted up at the bar having a Mazel Tov
"Put the gun down",
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
You better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? The lease up
Should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facin'
So, it wasn't a choice, it was I had to do this.
'Cause I'm not living up to my own expectations. Aww.
Uh-uh, I survived it and that's a miracle

Slow fire'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak, and when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up, but you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up and not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it,
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink

And ended up dying to fill out in the heros splinters (?)
Said not 'til she gets her act together
That should only give you more fuel
If this chick was my own mother

Skim through the music to give shit reviews

May consider tryin' to reinsulate ya windows may be in or another crazy winter
No no man, I'm going first, 
And I'm so lost without you
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
Hello? Fuck you then
Serial killer hiding murder material
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
How to incorporate a curse
We're liein' to ourselves,
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
Saying "I'm gonna come!"
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there
The way she moves she dances like a go-go
Trying to process this loss is making me nauseous
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me.
Bobby Creekwater, and basically man
Some days I sit starin' out the window
I'm 28
In appliances by the washers and dryers
Made for me say fuck it kick some shots back git hammered and nail her
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
'Cause when I am not then I'm 'a stop pinning 'em
And I realized, she was the crazy one
44 mags a fascination, a taste for disaster and if that's the case then...
Now your brain's all haunted 'cause of all the shit you thought of
I'm up 'n holla spending dollars ain't feeling no pressure,
Something just ain't right with me, dawg
Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper... Eminem
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick
but I know what I know and I know what you think
but I know what I know and I know what you think
Yo Detroit, know i can feel it,
Going noâ€”, going noâ€”, going noâ€”,
Going noâ€”, going noâ€”, going noâ€”,
Going noâ€”, going noâ€”, going noâ€”,
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
Ew ew ewThese ideas are nightmares to white parents
OMG
Let us never forget it or should we ever live to regret it
No underwear, grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it
I can almost see it
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
What a way for 2018 to get underway
Now walk on 'em.
A tisk-it a task-it
We'll come through the side
"The Maniac's in" in place of the doctor
No, officer, you see...
Heh.
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
In fact let's be honest
Oh my bad, slut
Cause we started thinking god doesn't love us
But I keep putting my fucking foot in my mouth
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
Get some R and R and marinate in some marinara,
It was almost a homicide that you caused 'cause I was so traumatized
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch
And I'm aiming right at you
And I'm aiming right at you
And I'm aiming right at you
And I'm aiming right at you
And I'm aiming right at you
They say love the one you with
'Cause now when we get home, we get jealous
I'm at the top of my game
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
(Ok here we go) do-re-me-fa-so-fa-so-la-ti-da-so
Shady dog, what be going through that fuckin' brain of yours
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
Marshall I'm so jealous of you
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker
It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
Who would've thought, standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
And people that you don't even know jump in?
And that's more likely than finding someone that's
I said, "Be careful driving. Don't read this and have an accident!" She glanced to look at it and wrecked
I love my city,
Well I got news for ya, homie, you losing her. Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast.
In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
I make elevating music
But no one really gives a fuck cause they just like what's spinnin'
You catch an open hand slap like a female like bap
And send it to Mitch McConnell
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Back wit Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
you wanna harass with this limo tinted glass
Up, binds up, cuts, slices her twice
Business guess I'll just never get
I put lives at risk when I drive like this {*tires screech*}
Want some gum?
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin him
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes?
Mad at me understandable, cannibal shoot an animal out of a cannon and have him catapult at an adult!
The whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get
Grab my flannel and my bandanna then
I run this rap shit, now guess whoâ€™s back
Never been swayed by color or skin shades
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!
I don't know, I don't know what caused, I don't know what caused me to be this way
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl

Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin' this year again?
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Then climb in slow to shatter
St. Vincent de Paul, those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
There's nothing left to do tonight
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
The way she's grindin that pole
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
And my plan is to get him next
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Nigga, that's Soul 4 Real
He says: "No! " - She says: "Oh!"
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last.
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
Shark mandibles, lambs to the slaughter
What a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
'Cause I'm stronger than I wasFeeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's "Freaky Tales" (Biatch!)
All my dogs is out the reservoir
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)
I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)

Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
Twenty six and I done lived a life time a few times
That's what it's comin' to
Thought some time had past and I'd forget it, forget it!
Looking for me, I'm underground
Looking for me, I'm underground
Looking for me, I'm underground
Looking for me, I'm underground
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
And make her wear a bathing suit and take her para sailing
The pressure, they want me to follow up with a
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
You don't wanna fuck with Shady ('cause why?)
It wouldn't be
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
But the muff diver must just like it rough
("Go sit the fuck down, you little fuckin prick!")
Some nights I want to run for the hills
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
But, bitch, I got an elevator in my house, ants and a mouse
Dre. I'm down here under the ground
so bring it
They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head from out behind
If there is,
If there is,
If there is,
If there is,
Get me on track They love me when I'm on that stuff
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Or no brain, nice to meet you
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'
When I say I'mma do something I do it
making dead presidents, you know what I'm saying?
Don't you get it, bitch, no one can hear you?
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
As fuck when it comes to this pen
Rest In Peace
Why do you date me if you say I make you sick?
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team
Oh-ho, whoa-ho
Let's end this shit now 'cause I won't stand for this
Fuck money I don't rap for dead presidents
With a new rag
Turn the town upside down with a frown upside down,
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
I go to walk to you
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and care free
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
There's too much on my plate
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Looking for Big's killers, dressing ridiculous
And like, back and forth because ah
In three different locations
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm better than I ever was.
is cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet
You walked out, I almost died
Somebody should have explained to you why
It's pandemonium standing know when you see him, oh
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
(SSHHH)
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
For this one it's the X, you retarded?
Get your ass beat at the basketball court on spite
And found a way to mess it up
"Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?"
She said "Come her big boy, lets get acquainted"
Living up in these streets
Living up in these streets
Living up in these streets
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
Uuh G.S.C. is 3
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
B-ballin' Uncontrollably
B-ballin' Uncontrollably
B-ballin' Uncontrollably
B-ballin' Uncontrollably
I'm addicted
Ja sold his soul to sing
'Til the cops cuff us, we'll start ruckus and drop blockbusters
Tuck my teenie eenie weenie between each
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('cause why?)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('cause why?)
Have a heart attack and just
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69ing
I'm about as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
More than you could ever comprehend
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us
I gave you all, you gave me none
No one is safe from  In search of a brain surgeon 
Ahahahaha, that's why we're crowned the murder capital still (still)
Drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex
For those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet: a star
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
I'm getting tired of everybody wanted to go first man
all of the hatred for me must've died
I actually learnt a lot from you
He don't buy me no clothes, Nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
Angels won't find me (Just to spit in your fucking face)
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapse
Man you, better be conscious, I'm backstage
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
So we're in shape
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
But that passionate hunger's back
But I think it's inevitable
Until it dries for the moment I guess you're all safe
He's so cra-zay!
Take care of your mother
Stomping, I been romping since Tim Dogg was hollering
Don't take shit for granted
Just finish the rhyme and bust it, excuse the corny metaphor
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Nuts
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world so dark, a world so cold
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
Two ass cheek implants, call that an asset
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
Niggas get hit with a two piece, "Bling Bling"
Doesn't even fit you they don't feel you
Expect no sympathy from me I'm an MC
Inside a boombox
Blend in with the rest of the room
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Risperdal, voices whisper
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits!
Grabbed that bitch by her hair
The first thing I think of when I wake up
Squirted a frankfurter
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like route canals
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
I could be iconic, and my conquest
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
Other people say to me when I was a kid
Just as big of a bitch as Donald
Come again rewind selector
Plenty days, where I'm just in a daze and I can't pull
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
I picked it up and screamed, "Look bitch, what have you done?!?"
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
Get the Cloriseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3's
I came to fuck with your occupation
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
And piss on the lawns of the White House,
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
Where are you going? (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I wasn't even raps Elvis yet
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
While he looks like a canary with a beak
-plegic, boogeyin down to Frank Sinatra
and which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
Even if it meant selling my soul to get revenge and (What?)
Cause they could've sworn someone said Nuh-
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die Shady!" and pop it
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
'Cause that's what attracts us
Spit treacherous data
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
Hoe, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Cause IIIAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHAHAHAAA AAAAAHAHHHHHHHHHH
No apologies, y'all feelin' the force of me
check-mate motherfucker
check-mate motherfucker
'Cause you're doomed from the start, it's like you grew up on Jump Street from jump street
"I miss you" subconsciously. Wish it didn't end this way,
When the world gives you a raw deal
I think I can, I think I can
I'm waitin' for the day I can
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
I'm back for revenge
Girl you just blew your chance
Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
Someone rich that I could follow
Haha, and Slim Shady..You, you, you, you, you
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
God on my side
Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
So you better, you better run (Yeah)
With piles of downers around ya
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
Let me take you by the hand, to promise land, and threaten everyone
Swore my fealty, but word to G.O.D
Who
You're walkin' down a horror corridor
You've got a lot of drugs to do
If my funeral's tomorrow
Those were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no
'Cause all of my spare time's spent
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
Got to the crib and called her up
(Slaughterhouse!) 'Cause to us it's so easy
You're on fire, you're on fire
You're on fire, you're on fire
Mic check one two, we recording?
Shit-list renewed so get shit to do
Put your temper to more use
Hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin' a vest
E'eryday Dre day, front and cause a maylay,
These people think it's a crime
These people think it's a crime
How's this happening now?
I wouldn't heal with ointment
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you
I got some game that I'm preparing to run
And the lights go out in that trailer park?
Now my respect I demand it
Wherever I go, no place like home
Em introduced us, "50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50"
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Everyone's leanin' on me
Everyone's leanin' on me
Everyone's leanin' on me
And I just can't keep living this way
To describe the shit
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts
It's no exception, it goes for every man
So let these words lift
I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
I watch her grow up with pride
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance 
Soon as the blade spun run, they run away from
Just so happens she's fond of algae
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
Nigga fuck my wife I'm tryna run and save my motherfucking life
Yeah, yo I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts and see where this takes me, 'cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
People just get sick 'cause you spit
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
I will stand tall,
You recognize me and had Milo flip me off
till i pull the paint off
Niggaz that take no for an answer, get told no
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
But that's water under the bridge
Bitch I'm still in that mind state
Like the day John F Kennedy was assasinated in broad day
No need for an assumption
Oh fack I think it's stuck
His name is Mr. Shady
Shut the fuck up!
It feels like I'm going insane
It feels like I'm going insane
It feels like I'm going insane
It feels like I'm going insane
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt 
Cold as a G, my hearts frozen it don't even beat
Come back the next mornin'
Not even on my radar
And how I'll never hold you again
And it's a disaster
While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin'
(Damn it feels good to be home)
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
Shady slash Aftermath and Detroit, motherfucker!
Countless times I've been outed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing
One when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
'Til everybody eats my turdsYou know I just don't get it
Losing all of my leverage
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
Probably end up on top of them
Definitely back up in this bitch, You swing? All hell breaks loose
I'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down
You make me crazy,
Don't fall on my face (yeah)
Don't fall on my face (yeah)
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?
But you must be Token if you think you're takin' over my quarters
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
what I'm 'posed to fight with bare palms?
I can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
And straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh
I'm on a roll, around and around I go
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia
Guess I must have just blacked out again
Like what? Like a real thin joint, it
Let her ass go
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-ag
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again 
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
(Ha hah-ha, hah-ha! Ha hah, hah-ha, hah-ha, hah-ha)
I'm an uncooked slab of beef
I'mma measure my dick shit I need 6 inches more
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
I got the machete from O.J.
This gold fish poke gets old
"How's it going girlfriends, you need a boyfriend?"
Pulling tubes out
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
This is America
This is America
This is America
When I break in your basement
I'm trying to maneuver the hoover up in your poop shoot,
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
Crusin' on the freeway
'95, '96 ('96)
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
'til I get a call that god's coming
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?
(I'll sit On You!)
(I'll sit On You!)
(I'll sit On You!)
So do-si-do with a sociopath, everyone who knows me knows that
Now let me cut these niggaz up and show em where da fuck I'm comin from
I roll over and go to reach for you, you're gone
Homie the veggies on my plate can fly,
Is more than twice than a black life span
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness
From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line
Which drug will I end up dead from
Find me a brother who's solid
Now I could have either just
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blasting out your deck, "She loves me".
Stay away from him he ain't no good!If I could rewind time like a tape
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad
But if you think that you're fucking with me, homie you're on one.
Time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke
Another late night in, she stumbles through my door
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
The business way to end this I can feel the tremors tremendous
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
When I was little I knew I would blow up
Zeroin' on the target like a marksman,
Why do I feel responsible for these kids?
But nothing comes to mind (Nah) besides the number 90 (No)
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your fuckin' switch, nothin' can compare
I'm asleep at the wheel again
Using the bathroom vacuum and a racoon,
or say "he ripped that Biggie verse or that Jay-Z
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)
And nobody's close, so don't compare
Is it gay to play Putt-Putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And mosh for the future of our next generation
Yeah, dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you.
And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me
I got the Midas touch When it comes to rolling shit up
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
You swear to god you was playing
But this is why I
You should know between us we was like mates to soul
somehow, someway - tell 'em, nigga
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
2001 and forever
Do not let me catch you slippin'
For the games that we play with each other
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-by baby...
I feel the ice cracking, because
Whether separate or all of you band together
I could turn into Invisible Kid
"Dick"'s too short of a word for my dick
hate to be dramatical but I'm not romantical
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
About Ja like he claims he does
Your Superman, your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
of plywood
Sh-sh-sh-shady
When they get jealous, they confuse it
Who pops up now and again (again)
"Thanks dog. Name's Todd, a big fan" I
Quit callin' for me, hard proof's how I respond to
Be smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
She brings my name up constant."
You let me beat the shit out you
Next time I inspire you to write a song, c'mon
I lace tunes, I'm out this world like Space Moons
Hook it inside your mouth, go...
'Cause I'm a renegade! Never been afraid to talk
'Cause I'm a renegade! Never been afraid to talk
'Cause I'm a renegade! Never been afraid to talk
Would you calm down you're starting to scare me
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
Holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
I'm callin' all girls
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
My vocal cords won't permit me
And have a loosie, goosey as coozie is with an Uzi
Shady records, what you know about it?
Cuz she found out I was havin' an affair with her 10-year old niece
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre.
Will at this gun on my waiste-line,
I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak
So Lord forgive me, I'm hearing voices
Nah, I'm off him, but what the fuck's all this trash talking about?
Britney and Justin videotapes of them fucking
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit
No one's more ignorant
You ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
Please don't drop the bomb on me,
Please don't drop the bomb on me,
If you stare at me and see yourself, 'cause you're one too, shouldn't be a shock be
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch- end of story
I just said it - I ain't know if you'd do it or not
All you do is cry, bitch, keep it real
Don't stop
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound.
I'm not gonna stop, the saga continues
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
No one, no one's iller than me
Nope,
Opportunity knocks once, it ain't knocking again
Up the center of the dance floor
All the people up top on the side and the middle
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
It's poetry in motion like Freddie Roach when he's quotin'
Long as you know you're up to evil
The ultimate
I'm like, "Guidance - ain't they got the same moms and dads
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
It was a black Mitsubishi with
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
Hehehehehe, to be so young and naive
Captain of a cult, with an elite following to turn Halloween back into a trick or treat holiday
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
I will bajs on you I don't care who you are
Probably 'cause
Before I met you, I'll bet you I'll be just fine without you
Before I met you, I'll bet you I'll be just fine without you
Before I met you, I'll bet you I'll be just fine without you
In my mind I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
So how can we have higher standards?
So I'm assuming all responsibility
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
Go through the roof for his shit
Always, you can see him lurkin in the hallways
Be careful what you wish for
Be careful what you wish for
That's cause you whack!
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
I'm practically squashed, unpacked it and boxed it
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
grow to be but if you take a look
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
"I don't even know his name"
You'll never fill my shoes
but to me it was, see
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
Slumped over bleeding J.F.K
No, not a-now, not a chance, not today son
After the track is demolished
It's my right to insist
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
One Excederin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I have ticket, look, I put it away my zipper's zipped
And you'd think with all I have at stake
Psych, I'm kidding
And everything's spinning
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
I got a lotta more
I don't need nobody to play with me,
Gee willikers Dre, "Holy bat syllables!"
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)
'Cause I found a hella way to fuse it
Doing the Bankhead in a restraint chair
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
I deserve respect; but I work a sweat for this worthless check
Through it together, a severed earlobe
In the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
This song is dedicated to all the happy people
'Cause this keeps happening
Get money to all my real niggas, man
teach-er, her, him, is it you is it them?
Uniting together tonight, so make it last and you better just
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
I apologize even though I know it's lies
So now I'm catchin' the flak
There's a seven-disc CD changer in her car, and I'm in every single slot, and you're not. Aww.
Eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Slap me now Iâ€™m slapping â€˜em back hey! fuck it weâ€™ll slap back
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Raising my fingers to critics, raising my head to the sky
Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it
Leavin' every amateur inoperable, I finished 'em
I know I should let bygones be bygones
When someone tries our patience
The pen in my hand is shaking, please excuse me
Aight
Aight
Then the sheet over my head
To stick her neck in my mouth
Victory laps
Smash
Or maybe itâ€™s cause I ainâ€™t black, maybe itâ€™s because of that
Mics get sandblasted
yo they don't know shit about this
Tell em why,
Strength to cause Shady-mania
And now I'm 90 days clean and uh, that's all I have to share.
In pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
'Cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Talking that junk like you went black, guarded your back
Posted on any corner on any coast I'm on
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf yeah
Motherfucker comes out
And had this put to bed
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
Daddy's here
Accused for every crime known through the equator
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul, got a stripper pole installed
Alright now we, we're going to conduct
I had to go see the doc like Kool Moe Dee (Yeah)
The sky darkens, my life flashes,
My life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos
You know the fucking drill
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
And all I can do is follow the music
Poo Poo Ca Ca
Poo Poo Ca Ca
But be careful what you wish for
But be careful what you wish for
But be careful what you wish for
Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me
Aha?
Back and forth, they scream and shout.
I everlast, pen is mightier than sword
I don't, I don't got much self control, I hope that you running
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing
Won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing
Well Dre signed you
That he acknowledge my existence
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
One time for your motherfucking mind, we represent the 313
I'm every guilt trip the baggage you have
And we're starting this party from duskOh, this what we doin'? Alright
I'm hatin' my reflection. I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors.
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you
"I'm withholding my anger
(Slim!)
Grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
There ain't no punks over here, so follow me
Golly-wally, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Cause I serve any stranger with money
I sit alone in my home theater watchin' the same damn DVD
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Ha-ha, you don't look too happy to see me
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick - ha ha!
It's like a Groundhog's Day
Screaming "I don't give a fuck!"
Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
Way bigger fish to fry
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Be all up under her fingernails
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Live at the edge of darkness and light
Who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole' emcee'd
I can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump
Look in his eyes it's all lies
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful (hehehe)
A good dad, but a bad husband
A good dad, but a bad husband
A good dad, but a bad husband
Swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that this schmuck
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
In a verse and be charged with first degree
Even if a steep climb I must take
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
To try to thwart him
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
Faggidy, faggidy, fagidy, ragidy Ann and Andy,
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Owwwwwwww!)
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
But, bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
(I'mma kill you motherfucker!)
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Find the light, find the light, find the light
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (What?)
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Better call the cops on him quick fast
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Radio won't even play my jam
Radio won't even play my jam
Radio won't even play my jam
And open up a whip-ass canister
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
But obviously assuming you will be
Music is my time machine so call me
Y'all gotta move
Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rapping?
Missing what I remember, kissing and hugging and squeezing
Little baby with large balls
I've had as much as I can tolerate
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out, or you better not come out
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck
So when you refer to the guy next to the doc, you meant shredder
You could just close the chapter
He's a little under the weather,
Icicle veins, mics will get slain
Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
I'll kick a six-year-old in the ribs
"Fuck it!" until I met Dre, the only one to look past,
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
"But you kill each other, facts
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
Deeper, and it's off to H.E double hockey sticks I go
Livin amuk, never givin a fuck
I'm hot dog, no you're not, I'm the guy with the Oscar at Meijers
I'm back with a vengeance, homie,
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
When I end up backin' into ya
Laugh it's funny
(What that mean Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eating
and when the police come we fucking shoot it out with them too!
You're so sensitive
'Cause damn it I'm still theâ€”
Saw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
In produce, hunched over, giant nose bleed
Or have his body bag get zipped
You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes
But can't escape the sirens
Now where the flowers grow
The bad apple spoils the bunch I'm back at you
As a motherfucking drug addict like you didn't experiment?
So I been givin' the media fingers
But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
'Cause with all this A-B-C shit, I'm starting to sound like Alf a bit
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
(I'm screamin' out no regrets, {took it all})
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juiceWhere's my snare?
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
Hop on the freeway, tryin' to get some time alone and just think
What do you mean "freeze"?
What do you mean "freeze"?
What do you mean "freeze"?
No matter where you run, I'll be right there,
And this joint, no exception, so just point a direction
What the fuck do you think that colostomy bag is for, looks?
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
Till I went to the lengths I did to meet you
And met a new wave blonde babe
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturing
We know what it's about,
Come here little kiddies, On my lap
Whether you're a fag or lez
Sayin' I should quit (ah)
said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life (Help me! Help me!)
They spat in my face, now Iâ€™m back to do them the same exact way
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
You're gonna have to come identify the remains
Ma, show 'em how it's done
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die
I'm leaving air in your lungs
I'm at your throat like strep
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
It hurts when you see your friends
wait that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it
Now, what's his name?
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume
No more tomorrow's. We're done.
Have that I don't? Are you tellin' me tenderness?
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Now let's see her have triplets, and I'll disintegrate them babies
Who can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row?
And this time I won't give it to you easy
So maybe the 80's made me crazy, I been tryin' to get my weight
Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)
Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)
Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)
Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)
Like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump N' Grind" comes on
Shove a gerbil in your ass
Shove a gerbil in your ass
Shove a gerbil in your ass
Shove a gerbil in your ass
Of this liquor store
How 'bout some coke inside of your saline solution IV?
Left my girl in the house alone, is that my soon-to-be-spouse's moan and the further I walk the louder
why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
But I can't take a shit, in the bathroom
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
I'm barely charting myself
And fifty can take 9, (BLAOW!!),
Call me a faggot 'cause I hate a pussy
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
But I don't know what
A pad and pen'll be great, but a napkin'll do
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurring
ya drunk
Now some of you, might still be in that place
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air
this is me talking motherfucker
When I say I'm bringing the TEC out
Fast forward some years later a teenager, this is fun, sweet
Your Willy Wonka persona won't help you any longer
'Cause if I get burnt I'mma show you what it's like to hurt
And there's really nothin else to say (that's right)
And I don't need you (no more)
And I don't need you (no more)
And I don't need you (no more)
And I don't need you (no more)
And I don't need you (no more)
And I don't need you (no more)
Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy
peel back layers upon layers of
I'd rather have you whip my ass
We clutch it isn't much
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
How many times you've fucked me
Phases, that I go through
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
And nobody fucks with him
Oh, yo, ho, hello there
My god!
And if they don't let us in through the front
The nights are long I'm growing older
The nights are long I'm growing older
Yeah, bitch I told you I'm a dog (woof, woof)
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Come on children, clap along (SHUT UP!)
Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so
I'm almost famous
Which makes black lives madder
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
I love the way you move like that
I love the way you move like that
I love the way you move like that
But my fucking mouth was nightmarish
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Surely hip-hop was never a problem
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
While these dudes tryna figure out
Say it'll change but it never does
(That's Nickel) Ridin' around this block
I'll just take a couple more. Yeah, you're motherfuckin' right.
Coz I'mma sock it to you
Nick I ain't never seen an ass like that
But I'm just a second grader
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare
Prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris Wheels,
No wonder
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
I think my dad gone crazy!
I think my dad gone crazy!
I think my dad gone crazy!
I think my dad gone crazy!
I think my dad gone crazy!
I think my dad gone crazy!
I think my dad gone crazy!
I think my dad gone crazy!
I think my dad gone crazy!
I think my dad gone crazy!
I think my dad gone crazy!
I think my dad gone crazy!
I think my dad gone crazy!
We're both evil in our ways,
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Bagpipes from Baghdad
On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (Yeah)
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Off of his own employee
And I take great pleasure in introducing: 50 Cent
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
I don't see why y'all even started with me
Ibuprofens, like a drop of rain in the ocean
I don't know, but I don't want to grow up to be like Ja Rule's little dirty-ass kids
That I don't need the fucking swine flu to be a sick pig?
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
That I'm under
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
But at least we know that we share this common bond,
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Hip hop ain't dying on my watch
Goodnight, goodbye!
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is
I'mma ride to the death, do you rep that way?
I'm fittin' to kill 'em and dumpin' their fuckin' bodies in the lake
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
Need a fix up I'm the big shot
Beat a chicken, eat a chicken like it's a big cock(?) bawka-bi-kaw
I can feel tugging and struggling
I'mma name her Bonnie
"Debbie don't let that fucker get you upset
I got too much baggage or I'm too fuckin' dramatic, man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (Bitches)
When the Uzi pop, you better drop, when the music stop
I done touched on everything, but little boys
I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
So spread the word 'cause I'm promoting my passion 'til I'm passed out
What?!
And thereâ€™s nothinâ€™ in my way so I may aswell fly away
Instead of tryna escape through my comics,
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Whose instinct's to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
Me and Eminem don't need nothing but my and his money
I don't hear no sound, I should get ready for the show now
Big with your remarks 'til I swing an icepick at your heart
Then chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So you just look like an idiot
So you just look like an idiot
So you just look like an idiot
So you just look like an idiot
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
Getting sentimental as fuck spillin' guts to you
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
But all you're getting is bribe
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
That's what I said at my dad's funeral
But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
I'd be exploding soaked in self loathing an mourning
But something changed
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
No opponents can compete, and I've never been known to retreat
Maybe you need-ed meMy name is Marsh and this world, I'm out of it (Out of it)
Was a have-not (Yeah) 'cause my pockets (Uh)
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And give me one more time for old time's sake Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake 
We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass!
My darling,
My darling,
My darling,
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
Stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
You fuckin' broad, get in back, you're comin' to Florida with me,
It's sure to be the last
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, haha
Bitch shut your fucking mouth
When something's in your mitochondrial
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'for you came here?
I know you're not dead!
Every minute there's a sucka born
And Proof, I'm truly sorry
So lately mind state's get better each day, replay my relay race
That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
And stumbled on 'ta Jeff VanVonderen
Talented with the tongue motherfucker
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her
Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT,
'Fore a door shuts in your face
You'd give anything to get a record deal.
I just don't know how some people can be so good
And bury to make sure the tradition carries on
So won't you please jump off my dick
Middle fingers, put 'em high, that's why they call it a bird
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul,
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
You try it'll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me clowns
'Cause (I'mmmm) Shady, they call me as crazy
They call me a freak 'cause
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down!
Well I'm back
Pass the K-Y
Instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds,
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of the way that
Pistol play ricochet, see where the victim lay
My disk slips and disconnects
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
'Cause we're going noâ€”, going noâ€”
'Cause we're going noâ€”, going noâ€”
'Cause we're going noâ€”, going noâ€”
You left our family in shambles
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your mamma's heart
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
In the dark, my dogs all bark, like, "Woof!"
But he just keeps feeding him pills
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
Music, please
I can almost taste it
I can almost taste it
Cause I want you to triddy, yeah I be on that shitty
My equilibrium's off, must be the lithium
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
And I thank you (uh) 'cause you made me (uh) a better person than I was
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal
I tear the club up for sure
I tear the club up for sure
I tear the club up for sure
I tear the club up for sure
I tear the club up for sure
I tear the club up for sure
I tear the club up for sure
Just bend over and take it like a slut, OK Ma?
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
I'm climbing out this abyss
Now say you hate homos again!
Bitch, you listening? Tryna turn me down
Just let me lay back and kick some mo' simplistic pimp shit
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
I can see the evolution as we creep up on it
Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage
Come on an everybody come on an
Come on an everybody come on an
Come on an everybody come on an
I don't know what words to use."

You talking nonsense to walking bomb threats
My elementary they ganged up on me and sang this song
Will you tell us a bedtime story?

Shit head with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Is what I tell myself
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
Show me nipple I pinch, throw up, and throw up a ten

Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef

He does not mean to lesbian offend
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
When on the steps I met DeShaun at Osborn
I'm in another category, man, don't put me up with them pop stars
For I know not what I've done
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh
This don't mean I'm gay, I don't like men
Stuck in this house hibernatin'
If I had one wish

It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
All I can hear is drama with mom and him
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
Man, what's the matter? Have you no manners? (no!)
Half animal, half man

Toots, used to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
My chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't
And they gon' say a sniper just appeared out of no where
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog
that's how dudes be getting sick, that's how dicks be getting drips, falling victims to this
Drug sickness got me doin some bugged twitches
Thinkin' fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause
I'd be a savage beast if I ain't have this outlet to salvage me inside
Life is no Nintendo game
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this 
It's making me play hide-and-seek like Jason, I'm so hungry
You wanna throw me out? That's fine!
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
In make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
None of these skills you just seen come free
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Ain't gon' do nothing but piss me off
Uuh B.P. 90 over palp
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a stand still

So feel the force of my spiritual images
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white,
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
'Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
Toxic, hands are arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content
I'm a hustler I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid

I'mma make you look so ridiculous now
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, but somehow I'm pullin' through.
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
Here I go recycling the same old song
and by the way
I'm single now
I appeal to all those walks of life
'Cause girl I got a sick whip
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
but you know who
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
Yes it can be, the fucking Antichrist back Danny and Satan in black satin panties
Cadillac Sevilles, Coupe Devilles
Nah, (What's your name?) Marshall
My name should've been bastard
Floss your teck, I'll beat you with it across your chest
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her)
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous
'Cause it just occurred
No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I
Love.
they ain't gone gimme my semi but I got my Whizz at
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
A little bit psycho, but I know that
No wonder my ass is wet my diaper needs to be changed,
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Wait, what?
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play
O-overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
Paris and Nikki's parents must be so tickled to cherish
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
I'm in a strange place
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got
I'm bored out of my gourd -- so I took a hammer 
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 
I don't know go play, Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Life is like a big obstacle
Ch-ch-chill like I d-d-do z-z-zilch (Yeah)
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album.
I need to slow down
Try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now i'm...
Shit's embarrassing, as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In the streets of Warren, Michigan we call 'em tramp stamps
You cannot fill these shoes
You cannot fill these shoes
You cannot fill these shoes
You say we're cut from the same cloth
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit
Little engine gone, little engine
Little engine gone, little engine
Just smile back
Just smile back
Just smile back
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
Awful, every time I lost you, felt like I had you in my pocket
And right now, it's a steel knife in my windpipe
They must be sluggin' it out.
Up with someone so unlikeable and shifty
And my take on some other rappers
And you falling off with your skills?
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly,
"Shady, listen..."
An angry man's power will shut you up
An angry man's power will shut you up
Druggling thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs
I might be walking blind fold into a typhoon
And band together for Charlottesville
And I'm startin' to blend in more
Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters
Dressed like a Jedi at a Best Buy on the Westside
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
No need for metaphores I get yours across when I write
You like graffiti dike, well I can pee pee and write your name,
Your blood curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car,
I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down
And it's gon' hit some
Still they swarm the gates
They don't know 'cause they don't see that I'm wounded
But I ain't no Jesus
But I ain't no Jesus
But I ain't no Jesus
But I ain't no Jesus
Some days it feels like you're all that I have
'Cause every Tom and Dick
And they say love is blind, we see each other fine
You'll be the first one
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
I ain't apologizin' for shit.
Eminem came Obie stat and proof too
Just one spark and it's lit,
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And up under your skin like a splinter
I'm fiending for some
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Ask what I think, I say maybe
Ask what I think, I say maybe
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Love the game, cold as ice you remain
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
("Give me a kiss!")
But I suffocate for the respect
We can chill, split a half a pill and a Happy Meal
Hoppin' off of the club's balcony
Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics
We don't take you serious, nigga, you shook
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Maybe next year I'll say ass and she'll make my pee-pee go
What I really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
The tall shit that will end up with his skull split
To all the friends I used to have - yo I miss my past
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier
This anesthetic is pathetic so is this diabetic waffle
When they sell out in stores the price triples
'Cause I don't belong in this world
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
I hope you'll sing along
I hope you'll sing along
With all of this nonsense it's constant
Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-
"Hey let me get your number; I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!"
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)
Am I dreamin'? Is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns.
Savage, but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But the shit's about to pop off, yeah, I feel you up
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fucking skeleton out
Graduate in your caps and gowns
But if at times my heart it seems like it's in the wrong place.
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
you bout to get ya motherfuckin asses jumped
But yet you're still alive
Never live to regret what I said
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too"
They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!)
'Cause we don't got no time to waste, so come on Denaun
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice suffice this time around
I'm trying to stop you from leaving
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Ya
I'm screaming at 'em with no regrets and I'm hulking
You can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
The bald eagle has landed
You better, you better run (See you in Hell)Yo, if you could just, for one minute
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of it
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
Contact was blown by Benzetta in The Source
And I'll treat the beat like a pitbull would do to a chew toy and destroy it, 'cause boy I
With these lyrics, weapons expert with
'Cause you told me you'd love me forever bitch that was a lie
I had to walk down my halls
I swear to Christ there are nights where
You could say I swore to protect
Just really jealous of me
Just really jealous of me
Just really jealous of me
Just really jealous of me
You got my knees buckling and weakening
I ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is
Inside it drives me crazy
To the Rapmobile â€“ let's go!
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
And if anyone asks
And if anyone asks
And if anyone asks
I'm high off speed,
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
and im not affriad to raise the stakes up
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em?
Karate kick the plaintiff
Same nurse, just heard say
It's only right I jack your car keys and run
Loco-is-the-motion, we comin through
But I'm takin' no crap hoe, here I go down the Bat Pole and I'm changing back into that ole maniac in fact there they go, tryin' to dip out the back door retreating
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (woo!)
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
All right, come on, let's cut the bullshit enough
That's why I don't try,
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
But now the lines are getting super blurred
But I don't think I'mma answer
Over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it
Spit in Jasons face while I vomit on Freddy Krugar
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Watch your fuckin' mouth
Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier than
I told em Iâ€™ll grow up one day and show â€˜em Iâ€™d be able to choke clouds
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get when you're real
But I blew, never turned back
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
And I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had (A big dick!)
The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost, just like I'mI'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
Drop dead and I'm a throw a fuckin' party after this
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
It's
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
It's got a ring to it don't it?
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
I'm trying to describe how I feel inside
Your bloodstains are all over this steel God dang-it
In your tail pipe, can't believe you fell for that.
I still love you though
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
"Yeah, Em, tight verse. You killed it."
Cause I know, when they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
'Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
Frantic, I'm trapped in a closet
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
and collapse the foundation around and they found you
Spell it backwards I'll show you
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
And to that boy on them sedative meds
I'm the rap Pernell Whitaker, the honorable minister
It's not a big deal it's nothing but some cash (let's go)
December I think it was, I was havin' drinks with my cousin
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
hottest block, don't stop, the response I got when I was knockin' it, clock steady tickin',
I'll be back in an hour or so
Someone else's someone else,
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Rappers avoid eye contact, that's outta respect
'Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face
Please dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
I'd count my blessings but I suck at math
But what about Jermaine?
I love you babyYeah...
Oh no I won't back down
Oh no I won't back down
Oh no I won't back down
Oh no I won't back down
Hate even going outside it
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
I need my meds, I peed my bed
Next I take it back, guess you can say I'm tryna unscrew you
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon,
So back and forth in my brain, the tug-o-war wages on
There's no place like home, no place like home
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
Like you picked an axe up and swung
Don't kill me, I've got two kids at home don't kill me, don't kill me
Just remember, I was here before you
May take the same route and way out as Junior Seau
Became a Symbiote, so
that boosts me
So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage overhead space
So it's off and on, usually more off than on,
Hit a fag with onions and split a bag of fonions
I'll murder you; I gauge and have me turn into a mad man
Ain't holdin' my fucking breath
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
I used to love her hooters now Carmen Elektra cuter
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (She came, uh)
I'm scream in the palace, sold out this evening
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
He's asleep, you say, "Let's meet around three"
Ya friend should've know not to front round here
Every time I think of you I puke
Every time I think of you I puke
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
I wouldn't say "fuckin" for six minutes
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
It's like I'd run in place
Mother, are you there? I love you
OK, I'm ready to go play
Yes Im livinâ€™ the dream homie, cant nothinâ€™ compare
River (ooh), we'll let the river run
You fucking do-gooders â€“ too bad you couldn't do-good at marriage!
Better watch out, now
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
A mixture of Whitey Ford and Mighty Thor
To chill and avoid my problems
I'm Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control
I got up out
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
Tell her I miss her,
My Great Aunt and Uncle, Edna 'n Charles (Edna 'n Charles
I don't even believe in breathing
That's the song I'd have sang to my daughters
Guts over fear (might shed a tear)
Guts over fear (might shed a tear)
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
That ain't what you like, ain't it? What about if I was as famous
But tonight, we ain't coming here to beef with nobody
Before I hit it she said
What bothers him all comes out, when he talks about
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
Now my head is overcrowded
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
I'm just looking for something to walk away with
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
That day will come before I stumble upon some ladies
Daddy's so proud of you
I spot you at first glance and go "shit!"
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
You can't kill a spirit, even if you tried to
That's what they want, they want you Marshall
There's a four-year-old boy lyin' dead with a slit throat
look up like I was seeking approval
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way 
And apologize after,
D's searching the whip, glad I left the mac home,
As we pick up where the last Mathers' left offI don't understand
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
you aint even gotta say much
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em..
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets arse squished
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins til amnesia
There's no place to hide
Charred debris floating
They gonna take you 'fore they take me
Ha ha, Nate Dogg
"Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
The sign on my hustle says "Don't knock"
Gotta take you in doses, but when you're not at my side
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge
at least nine of my friends
Big I did it multi before I die (nigga)
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
We ain't leavin', let's go! haha
You need to stop drop and roll 'cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip-Hop Shop to blow
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...
Only time you'll ever say I lost
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
What would you do without that?
Could not stress to me I wasn't grown, especially on nights
Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, X to the Z, Nate Dogg
Flavor my favorite Graham crackers with JonBenÃ©t Rams'.
I'm rippin' out of my clothing
You sat on a shelf, I feel like I'm a bust
Set it down go right back to the Chiropractors
Nothin' will stop me from molestin' you
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
'Cause I'm hangin' up this phone, boo you make my fuckin' blue tooth ache
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
Blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lips son
What's new, what kinda fuckin' glue you'd think I'd be if I was glue
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
But I just had to get away. Don't know why.
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion
But no one knows what I'm goin' through, so I'd use you
I'll hide for five minutes
Substance unknown
It's absolute pandemonium
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Women skinning and then cutting them up in chunks
They've got no name
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
And now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
And we can play the back and forth all day
All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (Shady ease up!)
Is there anyone out there
Is there anyone out there
Is there anyone out there
Is there anyone out there
Don't fall on my fate (look)
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound I surround the hydrants 
Then when I make spinach dip, it'll be placed in the shit
I can hear him start to gather
And smoke a pound of ses a day
Chew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
But hey man, I was framed
But hey man, I was framed
Cum
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol when I'm pissed now
Cause they know that they don't spit the same
I hold them at shoulder width
Now my Shady babies are all stillborns
way, what do we, turn the other
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
Completely, deep, and madly head over heels for you
Completely, despondent, and condescending
On the verge of going insane
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (yeah)
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden
Now who do ya think is more fruitier,
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
But they keep on dropping the torch
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
"Vietnam vet," I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
What about the make-up you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
That'll stab you in the head
If the blicka hit ya kisser, bet yo ass not remembering
Bitches
The start of a brand new America
After I sand it and buff it I guess that I'll paint
And Iâ€™m still alive, Magic Johnson arise
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
where he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi
Aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
I leave ya face leakin, run up in church 
Rain Man
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
When you're bit with theâ€”
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed 'Til one night he snuck in and said
And I don't quit, won't change,
That somethin' you won't give someone a lump in their throat
I should have known better when you started to act weird
Come with me to the dark side of the force
Wanna get it popping baby step right up
rrrbb lemme ask you again
On the track get spanked like he just did
Bring the beat back
Look - I'll burn your fuckin house down, circle around
(Godzilla, fire spitter), monster
(Godzilla, fire spitter), monster
Not a jealous man, but females lie
Fuck catching lightnin'
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
There are just too many things to explain.
Murderin', I'd rather go vinn-vinn, and now you see just how the
How many retards'll listen to me
Is playin' with ya but ain't shit changin'
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
(What?? That's my shit!)
And there's really not that many of us.
And there's really not that many of us.
And there's really not that many of us.
And there's really not that many of us.
I'm talkin' euthanasia (Euthanasia), like kids in Taiwan
Hash whiskey and ash til I slap bitches (smack)
So gimme all your money
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low the 'Vette look like a storm
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low the 'Vette look like a storm
cause she said
When you joke it upsets me, you say I'm no good at sex
I just get on the mic and spit it
F A C K F A C K
If I could get my weight up
its all fucked up now
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
I'm the real deal, and charbroil her on the bonfire,
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I ain't goin' with ya, forget ya!
If I'm there with ya, rich or poor
Day by day
That you'd probably just shred up--yeah
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
Bitches hollering, niggas running
Could never be the lead-off batter
'Fore you die cussin'
Cut down on the Valium
I can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I'm looking for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck
This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right ooh?
I'll get away with murder
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
'Cause I'm tearin' at your fleshful dead
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
But I think, I think the lines are starting to get blurry
Been texting you since three, I still get no fucking reply
I'm every nigga's favorite archenemy
Invincible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
So Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
It's like my mother always told me
Of elephant manureâ€”hell, I meant KahlÃºa
Swatch watches and sneakers matches with the Parkers
And I base whether we're fucking off that instead of your face, so
If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
Especially when I'm engaged
You know the name of the crew
That's like D-Bo fightin Peablo Bryson (I'll Shit On You)
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Two years later me and Doc had to come and, uh, operate
We came to party, Banks, Ca$his and Mr. Ferrari
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And here's to where we all
You better, you better run (So I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)
I'mma take control of this relationship
So I told em I was Mike D
We broke up, got back together
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
But we'll show up on your porch,
I'm allergic to dying â€“ you think not?
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Dip before somebody catches ya
So I decided just to pick this pen
And Benzino, you ain't shit but a bitch!
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world:
Got about fifty guns, and I love all of 'em the same - bang bang!
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
Doody, I'm trying, but you
(Don't know what I'm gonna do)
(Don't know what I'm gonna do)
And that fucker still talks to me he is all I can fucking hear
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
"Ooh boy you drive me crazy"
"Ooh boy you drive me crazy"
"Ooh boy you drive me crazy"
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks
I don't ever get a chance to rap first man!
But look up rhyme in the dictionary
Like a fucking headstand (Yeah)
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you?
cause I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know
"Rot in pieces, uh, that's great"
But I've finessed
And I try not to listen to nonsense
("Shit is mine, I gotta do this, gotta do this")
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
who else am i forgetting
Now you just backed me in one
We gotta take these cards ourselves
Living in this world without you
Living in this world without you
Living in this world without you
Living in this world without you
Living in this world without you
Like Speedy Gonzalez to see if I see anyone
This ecstasy's got me standing next to you
This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges
That the nigga from Soul 4 Real!
Damn baby you look good, you're giving me wood
Fuck it I ain't playing
I was framed
Fuck Eminem, he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man
we talking to every-motherfucking-body who wants to bring it cause we bringin it to anybody who wants to bring it
No girls, just the gin you drink till your car spin
Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
You guys are gonna make me...make me sad I'm sad
Hollering at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barking
Sunglasses with Elton John's name, on my drag wall
Indigestion, my suggestionâ€™s Kaopectate
With this ink, you haters get wrote on like a piece of paper
I had developed the
Its all psychologic, why am I so maniacal,
Fuck yeah I'm a basket case and I mastered this rap shit, 'til my ass gets wasted, 'til my assassination,
Still I don't have any manners
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (was in)
("Mmm, I don't know!")
Down and show this hussy who's the man
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Unless it makes an impact then don't bother
You weren't listening, I said I'll cop a squat on you
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
Oh, fourth- Dre, Drake, Lupe oohm touche
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell an' hit up Chess King
For finding me offensive
Within these parameters
But be reminded: if I didn't mention
Let's let our love unfurl
Let's let our love unfurl
Let's let our love unfurl
Just to see what we find
Just to see what we find
Just to see what we find
With that kind of rational man I got half a mind
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
Kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)Ohh, it's music to my ears
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My God, I'm so sorry!
Jump out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars
The diabolical one
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture
Come back on you ten-fold
Come back on you ten-fold
Come back on you ten-fold
I'mma do it just for Proof. I think I should state a few
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
All they did was ballooned it
The nights are long, I'm growing older
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she crying
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them
In a more derogatory way but
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
"Hey, it's me, Versace
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Eating their food and their baked beans
You're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel, boy
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
I know you wanna see me down but we aint gon die today
And now that I got you I don't want you
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
'Cause I'm back I'm on the rag and ovulating
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
You hidin, I make the president get a facelift
They've underwent
D-R-E and Shady, with Doggy from Long Beach
Defiance, giant scrotum
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Good luck Mr. Shady
Call this evil intent, like me in a limo (Yeah)
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
So he just tortures himself
Yeah nigga I'm about my business
No one was there to catch you fall
Bitch, you get (no love)Used to get, bent, now I represent to the fullest
Just sit there and act pathetic and sulk
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning
OK, so now you see the reason how come he
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Georgie porgie kissed the girls, make the girls cry for em
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
We settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust.
But he ain't stupid so quit tryna run them games on him
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Amoxicillin is just not real enough.
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
Girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
I get lifted and spin til I'm half-twisted
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah I got some home trainin'
Yo forgot that President man I'm trying to be king,
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey
{Hollywood}, sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
You can get capped after just having a cavity filled (filled)
Finger still up one of my nostrils
My body aches when I ain't
"Do I really belong in this game?" I pondered
Oh my God, fucking Bomboclat
'til the anger dissipates
Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside
Ima walking art gallery, a science museum,
Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a ruger, a Glock, and a nuke
Okay quit playing with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
You hype, popping shit in broad daylight
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
You'd better let go of 'em
Don't I give you enough of my time?
Just right for you and me donâ€™t laugh, please listen
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
Now I'm back with an appe-tite
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal, makin a living
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode

Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
But at least have the decency in you
I told him how you like it from behind
And I don't need help, from D12, to beat up two females
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
I had no other choice that was left except fill
I had no other choice that was left except fill
I had no other choice that was left except fill
I had no other choice that was left except fill
You ain't got a lick in yours
Who you think you're dealin with?
'Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
But I just took this beat to the cleanersYo...
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
Bullshit, you bitch, don't fucking lie to me
A box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
Swept it under the carpet
My favoite color is red, like the blood shed
There once was a saying that I used to say
There once was a saying that I used to say
There once was a saying that I used to say
There once was a saying that I used to say
I owe you nada like Haloti, partner blow me
With their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented
I think I can explain
I think I can explain
I think I can explain
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Get on the floor, man, and rep your 'hood
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
quit fooling with me
'What tha fuck did he say in his rap Em?'
I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back
'Cause I can see you're checkin' me out
Ya homie got clapped on, man I don't care
It's pent up rage,
and a Glock just to go watch Batman
Chew it or pop it, roll a bag or chop it
His name rhymes with so many different words
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
Who you think you a-are bitch?
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
What does it all mean?
What does it all mean?
Blood drippin from it, rippin your stomach like a paper mache
but I had already hit middle America
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
So here's what I'm facin':
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
Forever I'mma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
If you had a brain you'd be dangerous, a brain you'd be dangerous
If you had a brain you'd be dangerous, a brain you'd be dangerous
If you had a brain you'd be dangerous, a brain you'd be dangerous
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic
So instead of just admitting it
So instead of just admitting it
So instead of just admitting it
So instead of just admitting it
That's how I knew my mission
Which means you will survive
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
Do right and kill er'body, Drake mode (Hello)
Prowler, there's no one fouler
'Cause on the way back down I may
'Cause on the way back down I may
'Cause on the way back down I may
But I'm the greatest
But I'm the greatest
Almost as if to say
Knew the little boy with the chocolate chips, ahoy chip
Smoked out til I started bustin freestyles
'Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
Better hold on a little tighter here I go
Be your mom on publishin, get your ASCAP-ped
kinky finger lickin', and can on, semen's at my tip when she moans, I gotta slow down before I
This white hot light
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
Catch a contract on your head
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me.
You either loved it or hate it
Bitches, they come they go
Bitches, they come they go
Bitches, they come they go
While I figure this shit out
And instead of mourning your death I'd rather celebrate your life
And I'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted
Energized like a nine volt, ice cold
Flying down Sunset, smoking crack
Custom mustard stain
Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Kangols and car-heart-less cargos
Fuckin whore you better fuckin hold still
Ohh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty
So just remember when I bomb your set
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
And disguises, to hide their true colors
They won't tell me what not to say (nope)
I wasn't at the studio, bitch, what'cha do screw Dre?
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be staring gazing
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
To transmit through 'em, to make you put your ass into it
Edumacator they are
Klepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now
Remember me? ("I'm Shady!")
Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded
You can't take it, oh
But I look up to myself (Yeah)
Like they're in middle school still
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?
You keep talking shit now the squad called me
Cause I hate him so bad
I barely ducked and that's right
You don't know how sick you make me
You don't know how sick you make me
You don't know how sick you make me
Sick a-ya'll niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
Who can catch lightning in a bottle? Set fire to water?
Susan wake up
I am the Santa Fe, Mandalay and Orlando and Colorado and Columbine
Took your spot, parked in it too,
"Ah go fuck his brains out, if any's left in his head"
Probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Hoping that you reach for me
Hoping that you reach for me
Hoping that you reach for me
I ain't never seen an ass like that
I ain't never seen an ass like that
I ain't never seen an ass like that
I ain't never seen an ass like that
I ain't never seen an ass like that
I ain't never seen an ass like that
You can't go back there, stupid ass!
Get em
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
Plus I survive everything you got in that chamber
(Oh-oh-oo-oh)
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you must've been fate
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
We stuck to each other's hips and we can't
Now I've been hip-hop in its tip-top form
To replace next up Veronica's boobs
You couldn't see me with binoculars
time...
cause the apple don't
cause the apple don't
cause the apple don't
cause the apple don't
cause the apple don't
cause the apple don't
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me to take my belt
We are Americans
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
And chainsawing them in the basement
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me you knocked me down
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull
Or argue whose fault it was
Who just happened to work on the same block in a library book depository
Motherfucking gloves and a shover stuck in the mud
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna finna have a party
A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
Imagination's dangerous it's
You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
Don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
Put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
And it's bi-sexual sex
And them cyphers on BET cause if
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
I ain't been to a bucks an why I ain't snuck a weapon through, there's no
But if I could just get my head out my ass
most
A neck with bolts, "Nurse we're losin him, check the pulse!"
It's like an explosion every time I hold you, I wasn't joking when I told you
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
The question is just how far will this go
The question is just how far will this go
The question is just how far will this go
The question is just how far will this go
The question is just how far will this go
So one shot for the money two's to stop the show
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
They won't let me ever let them go
They won't let me ever let them go
They won't let me ever let them go
They won't let me ever let them go
I know you're there, but I can't see
I know you're there, but I can't see
I know you're there, but I can't see
Who wants to be sober gross?
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
And let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like
Censor you like that one line I said
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got, I don't care, don't have two shits to give
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
Ever seen, and back then it was like I ain't even
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
I can feel the heat rising, everything is on fire
A beastiality porno with smoothies.
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
gon' get that hoe, when you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo', cause you love
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
This is like a vibe you get
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
And I can pull any string
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear, while I freak this world premier seducing her.
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
I got a laptop in my back pocket
Bleed! Bitch, bleed! Bleed!
I sold my soul to the devil, i'll never get it back
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
So when you call, I come, I will answer.
So when you call, I come, I will answer.
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um
"Oh hell might as well try 'em this party is so drag."
From beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat
'Cause I just keep droppin' shit (I just keep droppin' shit)
So when they empty that stadium
I'm in your house eatin' carrot-cake
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
Cause your comparing to none, I wanna share in the fun
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama
Did you shit on these niggaz two times Dr. Dre?
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
That's why I may have came at you sideways
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
And the life we could've had and we could've been
we aint even have to say shit
Oh, it wouldnt be complete, If i didn't
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
I still remember the call up in ??
And I won't be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Ho, you better go back and listen
Yeah boy,
Yo, check it out
Are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
and how I should come out and what to rap about
It makes me wanna just take you,
so he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me, 
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But all the hate, I call it "Walk on Water" gate
Too scandalous, Sue Atkins
I fuckin RV up like Brett Favre
She barely was three months pregnant
The sound of a music box comes from inside a toy chest.
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
Ask Asher Roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon me
I'm in the light dark contract, Shady's back, nigga
So I promised the fuckin critics
Yo, snappin' necks plus I'm live, in effect
And you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
Started sniffin' it
Wait, the day ain't funny man  It's urgent 
It's playing a song so beautiful, and the room is dark.
Lid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off
Well screw you and I'll be the third person who screwed you today
like I just started giving a fuck what you really think about me
What did I do? (huh) I'm just a kid from the gutter
Why you make her read 84 bed time stories to you in baby talk?
or a new Shady, if they think it's gonna happen
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
Now I lead a new school full of students
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
There's nothing else for me to say,
You fuckin' pigs all you're good for is doink doink doink
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work
How many people you know
Like Anna Nicole Smith
But I still will stomp your head to a pulp (Yeah)
Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? He's tryin' to divide us
And stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
Come here let's go in here
Hey now, don't get carried away
And how I just wanted you to taste your own,
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
I was on the bottom of the pile gettin' stomped
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
Stole a Magnum box and bag Cirocs in back of a Datsun
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
Of another beat I'ma kill again
Nobody puts baby in the corner
Nobody puts baby in the corner
Nobody puts baby in the corner
We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Voices in my head, I'm going in shock
Hang me!
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth
That got "Banned From TV" - heavyweight hitter
You don't know, you better ask somebody
You don't know, you better ask somebody
You don't know, you better ask somebody
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
Forgive and forget is the only thing I'd ever live to regret
Yeah that rap was tight
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
So they wanna give me the chair
Made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Record songs for the Detox LP, feet don't fail heat, niggas got me bent like cranberry and bellvee?
What he can do for his to be a star
I wanna facking fack
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him
Going nowhere fast.
Going nowhere fast.
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
I was whilin', free styling back when they was still making Maxell cassettes
Round and Round
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Emiddinem
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my god its you! Not again!)
He's
These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots!
Are you from Los Angeles
Are you from Los Angeles
Are you from Los Angeles
Will hang you up naked by your ankles dangling
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick
And while this is goin' on
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
Swear to God 'cause if I go off the edge
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
Folk in the hood asking where I be, dawg I'm out in Hawaii, don't like it drink my pee
Cadillac from a K Car
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Everybody knows, that you're just an asshole
Blank stare dead pan look as my face as I gaze into space
But I do know one thing though
But I do know one thing though
But I do know one thing though
All you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
Here we go now
The center of attention back for the winter
Of my knife off, but your throat is slit
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
But I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store
When I say Hussein you say Shady
I'm not done (preach)
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, I made you a star
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
But what kind of lengths can you go?
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein',
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I never would've came in this game I'm going insane without you
I ain't never giving in again
Don't wanna be with you neither, bitch
on my forehead with a stamp
Sit down, bitch
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Just stay true to you
Just stay true to you
You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em even after
Niggaz just afraid, handin me they bracelets
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
These bitches tryin' get attached but there failin' to latch onto the tail of
complex from being judged
I'm iller than takin a hammer and beatin your knees
Most hardest, most honest known artist
I'm proud to be back
How much in your face am I?
Once again its the, illest and realest killas
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to Chemical warfare
Now come in girl!
We raise it, you better praise it
We got a buzz spreading quicker than making paper-airplanes out of a twenty
I'm moving on forget you oh,
Look at these rappers, how I treat them
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm busting a rap
I know
Thanks for sharing Brian, is there anyone else who would like to share this evening?
I'm tryna smack this one out the park: five-thousand mark
T.I., keep ya head up,
Told her to do like her dad, don't cry, get mad
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Burp, belch, then go back for a second helping Can you dig what I'm sayin' man, can you smell me?
Now climb in back try not to kick over the gas can
Me to walk on when I'm around her
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
But you're essential to me
Oh oh fack
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
Slip into the red dress you like
Slip into the red dress you like
Slip into the red dress you like
LL told me to "Rock the Bells"
That's why there's curtains in this murder if you gettin' worked up
That's why there's curtains in this murder if you gettin' worked up
As soon as there comes a day that I fall out with Dre
You're faithful, you don't lie
You're faithful, you don't lie
Here I am, alone again
You just holding shit up Now here we go
And I put the game on the pill (Yeah)
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
My name is Shady
My name is Shady
My name is Shady
My name is Shady
Oh, that's odd, I just happened
At Nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
But I'd make you this small wager
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
Bullet whizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! 
20 million other white rappers emerge
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say, "Isn't this great?"
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)
Fuck it, let's get to the meat balls
The light that you're seekin'
Oh, almost forgot to do something
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But it's embedded in my head. I never hunted for the bread and butter
When it scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out, "Awww!"
While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
If you could understand why I am the way that I am
But shit is in my hands, here's your life span
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time
It's 2002, everything was totally new
And I'm talkin' to you
Damn somebody hit me from the back
My honesty's brutal
When someone wants to test us
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middleman
Am I psycho or some kind of psychotic stick,
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold mean things I don't mean to say
Believe me, BET and MTV
Afraid I would never find a way out
How you doin'?
I'll be sure to Ginsu ya 'til there's no more skin to ya
I mean girl just touch my bodyPeople! It feels so good to be back
Here's what they want from me
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
Living off liquid Triametic
"Oh, what a bundle of joy"
Three's not a crowd all up in it
Killed them both and smeared blood in a white Bronco
They keep screamin' your name
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like a album
Deliver that shit that coroners like
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Here goes that broken record clichÃ©, it's all my fault anyway she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
We're gonna have a problem here..
They get so mad, when I call them both faggots
Who just happen to be on the crapper
-case with Denaun screaming "Who the fuck passed you the mic?"
That's when I seen the bedroom door shut
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit,
For you, so I could come back a brand-new me you helped see me through
I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
This shit makes no sense to me
This shit makes no sense to me
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Carpel tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis
Label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence
But makes life a living hell for me
I try and hide it,
'Cause I'm what you want to be
'Cause I'm what you want to be
'Cause I'm what you want to be
'Cause I'm what you want to be
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, dumm..
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
(Nigga I've been tryna call you all day motherfucker where you at?)
You's a motherfuckin' actor, slash Pac impersonating rapper
I told you this
Thats why I'm packing these nines,
T.I. ain't talking me off a ledge man
im patiently waiting for the day
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
In the clutch, I'm the Captain Crunch of rap
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
Vain Vicodin, vrinn vrinn, vrinnn!
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
As we set aside our differences
Nigga my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first, 
Intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
Today's like the morning after
I want my respect but ignore the
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Just not YouTube, 'cause...
To intervene between me and this monster
Appeal with the skin color of mine
Where's everybody going? This always went over real big in gay a
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
And I'll go down in the history as the blood sucking leech
How could it ever be just us two
'Cause I'm wipin' up everyone in this genre
Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
You're a fuckin' coke-head slut, I hope you fuckin' die
I got a whole story board for you, boy your da plot,
So come on, baby, the night's young
Yesterday I changed your diaper
hot, all the light that they given me an the haters like a chauffer because it's have driven me
Is pretty Marshall gonna have to go choke me a bitch?
Thank God that I didn't do it
Any hesitation'll get you killed, if you feel it, kill it
My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow, I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows
'Cause you may never get it again.
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
People ever give a shit what I had to say? It's just my opinion
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil rise)
Yo, yo, ayo (Evil rise)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
But instead I forced us to live alienated, so i'm sayin'...
Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
Gag, chloroform rag, dag almost hack-up a lung
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Of course we're about to stir up
I'da had my ass handed to me
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Jesus, I don't believe this, bitch works at the cleaners, bringin' me home diseases, swingin'
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Spray perfume in the sauna room
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Ask the feds from past the edge
Ain't none of you Doctor Dre
While this shit dangled in front of my face
shit is too easy
Slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts
Love, love, love
Till the cow just tilts and tips 'n stumbles to earth
But when it's all said and done I'll be 40
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (YEAH!)
She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck, I was born during the earthquake
Beddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
Man, I got everything candy-painted
One with the balls in your shorts
"You're top ten ain't cha?" stop cause you fuckers are talkin' crazy
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?
So why would I give a fuck about backstabbin' Trader Joe for?
I'm lightning in a skillet you're a fuckin' flash in a pan
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly I start ballin'
But you probably didn't know that, did ya?
It's they who raised me and say the can take me
From in-school to before school to out of school
'Cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable,
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
And dream of having a turn to earn money to burn
to pop pills and smoke pot til they brains rot (uhh-oh)
And last week, I seen a Schwarzaneggar movie
Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man.
Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man.
Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man.
Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man.
Tired of all this player-hating that's going on in my own city
He slugs, you're BBs, you're bean-bag bullets
I ain't here to save the fucking children
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
We'll take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
When he stumbles in, like, "Where the fuck you've been?"
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can)
I took my bruises, took my lumps
And you're still in love with me
Replenish, keep writing more
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Rummage through the shit, and try to salvage something to see if you can save any of it,
Full of myself, but still hungry
I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
But before I go
Nigga, on and on till the break of what
Wanna hold you, wanna choke you, wanna love you
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over
i dont stop
You can't teach me a goddamn thing
Thinking he can try and solve them
(Ha hah-ha, ha! Ha hah, hah..) I told you I was Shady!!
Can help you to resuscitate, You bustas must be flustered, wait
December 1st, 1996, dear Hailie
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
and your family in it (AH!)
Thank my father too
Slipped and fell, hit his back, boom, heard something go crack
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
You're bound to creep
He's in the bathroom; I think he's taking a crap dude!
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium and said
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in
Simon Cowell's rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
I was raking in the dough
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca Rebecca
Maybe raised to be racist
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
And which model, which lake they found her in
So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium ion
Macklemore, Mac Miller and Asher Roth
Now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head, I
I go and get another one, now I got two
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
So I'm taking his place
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
So there you have it, folks
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
I'll sit on you
I'll sit on you
I'll sit on you
I'll sit on you
I'll sit on you
Better try to stay wide awake
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
(What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?!)
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it's such bullshit, it's tush mull bisch
Took it and stuck it back up in my head
Rappers are having a rough time period
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red
Who's behind ya? Cadillac Pac or that transvestite?
Man I'ma say this one time, now get this clear
And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
To appreciate me, differentiate me
Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
And just throw you on the bed,
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
Don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins reenacting her boy
True statement, hate to go down this road
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
La prÃ³xima yo sÃ© que mejor me quedo sola
You better get a vest, then invest in something
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
And dry up your tear drops I'm here
Trick you with a back rub
Think about your mother."
But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
God damn man are you that much of an asshole,
But there was no one who even knew I was going through growin' pains
With ankle weights I hate to lie,
I'm like my skin is just starting to work to my benefit now,
Like a sewing machine
First off you don't know Marshall
Thanks.
My music box.
My music box.
My music box.
Now she's pregnant and gay, missing both legs and begging to stay.
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight.
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that 
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
I'm your secret admirer. I'm back to ravish you.
Because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel to O.J. to Glove
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Kelly Pickler hid my juice box under my bassinet,
Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
I start some trouble everywhere that I go (that I go)
Smoke it up then go wacko
It's usually once a month, this is some feat
You would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
And from here you look so small
You motherfuckers must just not know the tick-tock, so
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
Skilled as Floyd is
My days of being broke was so long ago, I lost my concept of money
I'll settle vendettas a little later,
I don't know when to quit throwing a fit
As you squeeze hold of my neck
It'll soothe this ache
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
So call it siblinÐ¿ rivalry
Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
I clock rejects into the next line
Shit, motherfucker, and these kids are like parrots
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
So I'm coming home tonight (yeah)
Damn.
I need a new outlet, and I know some shit's so hard to swallow
So name the time, place to battle
The more ignorant, the incident, is I fit in
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
God, come on
and these magazines'll never put it in ink
and these magazines'll never put it in ink
(Ha)
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
But it aint fiction its fact boy beware its real
But I made strides with these rape lines
We see the mornin' sun (sun)
He ain't given 'em shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
Like a tariff blows half of Madison Square up. Alas.
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin'
Let loose and bit the neighbors; wrist to razors
Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
No emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard
There's a game called circle and I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
Now there he goes in Dre's studio cuppin' his balls
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
But wait, wait, hold up, 'cause they say I almost
Proof
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
Down the hatch and the feeling you can't match it
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
May be true, till I told this bitch in gym class
I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
Titty fuckin' you 'till your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
You know who this is
Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds
off of the world's misery - what in the world gives me the right
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me
Living in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
At war we don't waste time,
Did I take it too far?
Or can't afford to be a label in this day and age,
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse please
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
Psychotic
Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anasin
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
So step inside a dimension
Should write a children's storybook (yeah)
I gotta tell myself another lie
I gotta tell myself another lie
I gotta tell myself another lie
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
Alright calm down, relax, start breathing
Tired of not driving a BM
Emptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud
This is pay back, like I owe â€˜em back pay
Besides the fact we breathe air
I shut your lane down,
If she keep her dinner down
But I'd be lyin' still if I said I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
You provide me the lighter fluid
(Six minutes, six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
for that, I'm past it
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
Or Chicka chicka chicka chicka jer jer jerkin the chain
But sometimes, when I'm sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, aim for the waist
Little ladies, be brave
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
Like? Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost
Ayo let me get that mic manÃ…
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
And hit the corner fast the more asserted
Just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a...
Mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
Seeing is how I blew up off of puffing them trees Well puffing ain't enough for me 
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
My flow all over the place, .44 in the waist
Cause I'm hyper or something, needing someone or something is lighting
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
He looked at me and said, "You gonna die honkey!"
Make a bigot racist uncomfortable
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
Aaahhh I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
Please! Please wake up! What are you doing?!
I can only tell you what it feels like
That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep?
An asshole, that role think I succeeded fulfillin'
We brought out the worst in each other
You say you're affiliated with murderers, killas (ayy!)
The 9 tucked against the lining
Shut the room down
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
Got niggaz in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
Live from the Terrordome, loud like a megaphone
for me to get some damn sympathy
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Blaow!) Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just bein Andre,
Resuscitated and rejuved so fuck it, I'm back
Me and this game, we got married already
CÃ¡llate boca mejor, maricÃ³n, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
(Whosssssh) My first day in junior high, this kid said,
(Could you repeat that again?)
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her)
That's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding?
And puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action
'Cause ladies' screams keep creeping in Shady's dreams
The game of love, love, love, love, la-la-la-la-la love
I must be buggin' the fuck out,
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
While I'm hittin' on Melania
Who could have known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nutsack
He cut my phone-lines
Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
I'm not playin', I want her back you punk
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
"It fits, perfect"
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
'Fore the pen, I stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)
Still Aftermath, 2006
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
Fix your bent antennae
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhyming one syllable. Naw.
So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, looking boy
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
To selling dope with the rest
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
Chloraseptic, 'septic
You're like the pillar that props me up
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
You have become Public Enemy Number 1Shady
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
Two minutes ago we was all joking and smiling
Who wait for me to slip with it so quick
Shut up slut chew up this mushroom
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
That bottle of Guinness is finished
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
This is just the song to go ballistic on
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
She's pro'ly back there with a damn machete!
When I go out, I'ma go out shootin
But I just can't admit
but, see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
You better, you better run (Cocksucker)
Yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?
Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?
Mentally ill from Amityville
I'm lovin' it,
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
But that ain't me, it's my evil twin
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
That I once used to call home sweet home
That I once used to call home sweet home
That I once used to call home sweet home
That I once used to call home sweet home
That I once used to call home sweet home
But fuck it there's other fish in the sea
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me
I go to open 'em
Nail her, "Baby, say hello to my little friend"
Oh I'm a misogynist too but I'm not a masseuse
When I was afraid to
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
You're a fuckboy, so next time
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
But that's normal ain't it Norman?
If I offend I'm sorry, please, please forgive
And in the midst of all this
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
sometimes I feel like
sometimes I feel like
sometimes I feel like
sometimes I feel like
sometimes I feel like
sometimes I feel like
sometimes I feel like
sometimes I feel like
sometimes I feel like
is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and fulla cars
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
Well can it load a gun up for you, and cock it too
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
So before you rest your case
That's fucked up!
I've never been less than clever and fresh
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!
In remembrance of september 11
On the wall of shame
If I walked on water, I would drown
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
She said "No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS"
Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me
Now don't ignore me,
Please I'm seeing guts
But I'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
I'm a stan of Redman, X-Clan and I'm a Treach fan
You're beginnin' to think women
Yeah...ha ha ha (BANG!), Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you
Whatever happened to wiling out and being violent?
Psych I'm spiking you like a football
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
But my beef is more media journalists
When it rains, guess it pours. Yes, it does.
And torture everyone, that is my plan, my job here isn't done
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want to skin
No need for no gunpowder, that only takes all the fun out of
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
We just met but I think I'm in love with you
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking

What I am is better than
Everything that we've gone through
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but
Yesterday was the tornado warning
And started whooping her ass worse than before
I said wait first try this hallucinogen
I'm out, y'all
Get the measuring stick (what?), twelve inches of wood
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Don't fall on my faith, oh (ha)
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
She's asleep, you're texting me around two
You'll probably end up jumping out of something up on the 10th
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with Jaws
Scream "life" as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute 
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
Then crashed in the side of locomotive with rap, I'm loco
Bodies drop, hit the floor
Bodies drop, hit the floor
Bodies drop, hit the floor

Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
Fuck with me now, bitch; let's see you freestyle!
Jacking off to a hockey mask at a boxing match (He can't say that)
Music is my time machine, so call me
Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough
So without further ado, I bring to you (Marshall!)
I say that shit's just clowning , dawg
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
Headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
("It's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute")
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gon' let 'em know
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Started from the bottom like a snowman
I'm Schoolly D, you're spoony, G
That has been the case since back when
Like I don't like this,
I'm God, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum.. dum

Point it towards corporate America
I ain't got time for fucking around, and horseplaying
I might as well give this up like heavy sales

Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with aids
So do what we say and once it's over like a suance, it hums
Crystal and slides huns, tonight I'm your pilot
I do not fuck with you guys
Your passions too much for you to not be dancing to it
Your head up high when you're dead inside and I just hide, so in
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
Came home, and somebody musta broke in the back window
I bust my ass for this shit and I swear
You almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), I got it (I got it)Ooww ladies and gentlemen
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
C'mon, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
C'mon, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
You about to get thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
It's probably brain damage..
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more. "Daddy, you're lying.

No wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders.)
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip then I fall in bed
Here comes the brigade
Cry til you get puffy eyes, red faced
And attempt to separate 'em, and stitch them back at the loins, shit
Chopping her hair off
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
'Cause I know you want me baby
'Cause I know you want me baby
'Cause I know you want me baby
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words
Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Gusto, guts, bravado.
I'm armed to the teeth, another valium fall off the bed
But Marshall is not an egomaniac that's not his motto
Then expect a longer life expectancy
Maybe 'til Monday, I dunno what day
It irked me, it made me mad at first
We're running right back
And I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
Beat, abuse you, treat you mutual
Don't be a retard, be a king?
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
No, I'm not the first king of controversy
Women dishin' but really
It-it's evident I'm not done
Only 'cause how good the sex was
I forgot my name!

I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
Goodness gracious

Bring in two extension cords
'Cause I'm happy
Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark
Just want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else
Sipping meds in the limousine
With the ballpoint pen I'm
And they can suck my dick while I'm pukin', and you too, you can
You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air Tonight"
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
I'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented
If the situation escalates
I'm trying to be the man, I'm want to be President
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me

Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists?
If you wanna go hard tonight
If you wanna go hard tonight
If you wanna go hard tonight
If I could only use this power for good
It's you and me, cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me,
There's no tower too high
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her
Like a bullemic woman with an uneasy stomach
'Cause I can't be your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman

Mr Mathers is the man
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
This bed's empty without you
I'm tryin to clear up my fuckin' image
Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Bed-ridden and destined never to leave the

Lesson five: Get a hook-up at jive
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
That's it (Yeah), so sick (Oh)
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
Ballin' back at a coffee shop.
Doo-rag wrapping my waves up, pockets full of hope
'Cause it's getting expensive
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fighting for air
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Where the fuck is the party at?
I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate
Don't mistake him for Satan
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach

Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK!
Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it"
Hey-hey! And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
To do it again, then, if he does it again
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help:
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
Someone's in like a son of a bitch
And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt a
I'll never get to walk us down
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
But I think this poor white trash from the trailer
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding with you
If there's anything you have left to say
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch...
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
To continue the pattern of abuse
Pull up on the side of you
With these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famousRicky Racks
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
Guess it's time for me to get the dust off and pick myself up off the carpet

Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
Quit tryna hold my hand, mista'!
And they can't handle it like a man
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I'm on 7 Mile what the fuck was that
So hit the dance floor cutie while I do my duty on this microphone
In the hood politicin, like I'm running for mayor
Money is what makes a man act funny
Now whether you're black, white or purple
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
I'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe
You aint gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus,
I said, "Hit the road," and after she left I sent that bitch a text
Instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
Ew
Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk)
In that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
That I've come to smash everything in my path
She loves the way I lie
Iâ€™m just a super easy modest MC, okay?
Won't go nowhere
Fillin' water balloons with nail polish remover
But everywhere I go they keep playin my song
What's the saying? Where there's thunder there's lightning
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her
So one more time for old time's sake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
It may not mean nothing to y'all
It may not mean nothing to y'all
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it.
We make the club jump everywhere we go
Never lack lust in that 'cause we act nuts
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today
(sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
You motherfucking chickens ain't brave enough
We just keep winning, by landslides oh and umm
For a dad to show up who never did
51 people asleep in my damn living room
Meaning abortions that live 'cause they were still born
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Ouch, look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall
Boy, I'm the real McCoy,
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
And I should not be woken
Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
'Bout to cancel the show, just as fans below rush the entrance
But, up I ain't done yet
You can call out your guards
You can call out your guards
You can call out your guards
You can call out your guards
I'd never let another chick bring me down
Iâ€™ma step up on the stage now, Iâ€™m gonna strut
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
When you got niggas hiding in your closet
The devil ain't on a level same as him
opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off
Every deed is a dastardly one
Man, I don't see why they hate me (Huh?)
But I flipped that script like a refilla a
Profitin' all for coppin' and scrappin' that property all for a possible monopoly
And I'm back with Andre, baby (Yeah)
And you just lick the plate off
Thinking 'bout an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
I'm popping percocets, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I know what it's like
To take a stand (to take a stand)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
When I'm a million leagues above you
So you tell me you love me too
'Cause he said that I eyeballed him
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And balance it with talents, wit
Here's a maxi pad
so thank you very much, here it goes!
so thank you very much, here it goes!
so thank you very much, here it goes!
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene but it's too late
Is cause of that fact,
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
Top 5 in this motherfucker and if I don't make the cut
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic
Two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
As a monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
I'm canceling Christmas to gamble and risk this
And keep going, I don't take shit from no one
Hogtie your squad and go bonkers
I'm tore up, demolished, a fuckin' stone like Oliver
what-what, what-what?
And you know I've always spoke the truth
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
flashing that flash-light on my ass where was you at
Here we go...
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
I run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit looking around.
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
Which is why I identify with the guy
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
It's a fine, fine line
It's a fine, fine line
It's a fine, fine line
It's a fine, fine line
It's a fine, fine line
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Get an anthrax napkin
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back
And that's pretty much the gist of it, Parents are pissed, but the kids love
(I'mma kill him!)
Heard you're back with the Doctor and I heard
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
My life has been turned inside out but I
Now why did they make Yoo-Hoo?
See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave
But I'm not gonna fall... bitch!
You feel me, y'all?
And imagine him giving an adjective an ass whooping
I'm sorry we're alone
I'm sorry we're alone
You one day being older and may hear me say things
Like Ice Cube said, "Before you wreck yourself" (Bitches)
Like Ice Cube said, "Before you wreck yourself" (Bitches)
Like Ice Cube said, "Before you wreck yourself" (Bitches)
Feelin' like I'm headed for a padded cell
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
Dum..I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah fucked in the head
Ha, I kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"
And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
I'll be right there for you
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off
Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
(Shit that's the clique we beefing with.)
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit, he'd go cuckoo ballistic
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
She insist she got more class, we know
Cops are knockin', oh, fuck, thought I blocked the entrance
Sincerely yours, Stan
maybe it wasn't a big
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
Sealed off in my lair
Ain't letting up, relentless
Chillin in the lab wasted
that Timbaland can't even get him in the studio
We say we do it for our baby but we don't,
Right now, I live in an igloo (Yeah)
Brian don't throw that (SHUT UP!)
'Cause I said motherfuck school and instead went to special ed
Why do I always come back? Oh
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice?
Through every nook and cranny looking for trannies
But I can't pretend there ain't.
Punch you in the mouth,
He's going too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
Help me leave this all behind
Help me leave this all behind
The same fucking questions (fucking questions)...
Wake up
Those who know me know it
So when I put this palm on your cat
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
Who's that mastermind behind that little line?
(Fire, Godzilla, fire), monster
(Fire, Godzilla, fire), monster
Baby what the deal
When Tupac was murdered in Vegas
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
I know you got my last two letters;
Now once upon a time not long ago
Shit I feel like I can do anything now.
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
I think I want you too
I think I want you too
I think I want you too
It's like verbal acrobatics
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the wizard
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain 
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause, Ma,
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
No matter how many battles I been in and won
We bout to have a party (turn the music up)
(you're gonna fuckin check this out)
And I was just checking the mail."
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
And we're starting this party from dusk
And we're starting this party from dusk
And we're starting this party from dusk
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
Singing, "I hope she's good enough
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in
So ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
But there's just something about her
The carpet is burned
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
But don't be alarmed if I sound off
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
And a fractured elbow
You're gonna need sutures the same size
Just to try to get me off, and you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
Wall Street, Royce Da 5'9", Slim Shady
And at the time I was going through my own struggles too
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new
Cinic keep em' thinking its a fucking gimmick when it ain't
I avoid Cupid stupid. Wasn't for blow jobs you'd be unemployed
already in the red
I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
We're still together in my head
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
But off of the dome would probably be a little more, more suitable for this type of song--whoa
Da da, da da, da da
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though,
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
And I don't think that I can stop it (Here it comes)
And I don't think that I can stop it (Here it comes)
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again 
Drivin' my car at high speed
So escapin' me is impossible
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
Your teeth gone like you been on some meth and some dust forever
Go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid
Look at y'all running your mouth again
You on Pac's dick, you a replica guy
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then achieve!
The worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass, man
So think what I'ma do to you, have done to you
"I'm leaving you!"
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"
I'm not done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
with no hair in between, know what I mean?
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
So sick I'm looking pale, wait, that's my pigment
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Point him out bitch I wanna know
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
Socked her right in her eyeball
You put your arm around mama
I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Which reminds me back in '89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
Pen game like I just struck in the tenth frame {Screamin' out no regrets}
Now bleed! Bitch, bleed!
Just know that if I could be there, I would
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
So why in the world do I feel so alone
So why in the world do I feel so alone
So why in the world do I feel so alone
So why in the world do I feel so alone
Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time
Woke up in a dream state
He said that he predicted his own death
You fuckin' retard, I'll have you suckin' farts out my seat
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is, stuffed
human sacrifices, canibalism; candles and exorcism
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
After the first night, but tonight I am
Into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
But no matter how many fish in the sea
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
Like Wu-Tang said, "You should protect yourself" (Animals)
Like Wu-Tang said, "You should protect yourself" (Animals)
Like Wu-Tang said, "You should protect yourself" (Animals)
You ain't have to have no money or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude
Cause I will never lay down?
You're a has-been
While I put a catheter in
But as you gather up all your possessions
Cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
It stays in the crew, cause it's just crew
That shit is not gonna change
Hopin' they'll come back with intel
Just ask me why I did it, well fuck it I can't remember
Concert after concert
can't dial out
Jesus, when does it end?
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
My sorrow echoes in this hall though
Before you make a decision that's life altering
People shot all over the floor
Nine millimeter, heater stashed, in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I'd never make it to sophomore
Half a breath left on my death bed
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
I will never stumble
I will never stumble
I will never stumble
Now get your ass back in that game, bitch
Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
I meant it as a dis, cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
B-Boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass
Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa
Who knows at this point, it's always poking so meh
Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft
But bitches ain't shit I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
And though me and my party days
You need some ointment, just set up an appointment
Oh wow I need a cigarette now
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
And here's some two-ply for when you date my friends
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
All these terrible, evil and awful mean things
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
Wrong subdivision
It may be early to be planning this stuff
Dreaming with a watering mouth
Fuck's the difference?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
If you ever wanna be one see
If you ever wanna be one see
If you ever wanna be one see
If you ever wanna be one see
The +Proof+ is in the pudding, just ask the Deshaun Holton
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
So tonight I'm sayin', "Bye-bye stepdad" (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', "Bye-bye stepdad" (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', "Bye-bye stepdad" (Stepdad)
When I'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor
Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (bling bling)
We're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us
Never ran with a click - I'm a posse
To go from sellinâ€™ bags to bottles right out the store
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
(You're drunk! You're never gonna get away with this!)
Shit look on the bright side at least I ain't walking
Let down my guard swear to God
and wacky tobacco planters
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Remember me? ("I'm 'High Powered'")
Watching me while I write this,
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it
and I'm not sure how this is gonna come off
Look at this house, look at these cars, they're so nice, wooo!
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper, Tupperware in the cupboard plastic ware up the ass
For everytime I reminisce - yo I miss my past
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
Tryin' to get paid 50 ways a day
So oh oh
Such cynicism when this isn't in my system
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac.
To hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said
Tryna save at Kroger (Yeah)
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh
Hundred bucks for these Percodans
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Who'da knew the buddah do to me what it's done
There's people that love me and people that hate me (yup)
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With that Latin hunk Luis Miguel
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
That I made a spark, started to spit harder
River (ooh), river run
then she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrongYea, (oh, oh), yea yea, oh
I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping
Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
Don't want no cum stain
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook"
What's goin' through my mind half the time
But I don't want it back!
Will someone please explain to my brain that I just severed a main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
If you care to be down cause ain't nobody Like you no where to be found
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
All I know is I wrote every single word of
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo of you
Just to see what it'd be like to
Just to see what it'd be like to
Just to see what it'd be like to
Lower than Chuck D ho
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low the 'Vette look like a storm (Screamin' out no regrets)
Evilish bastard, even you askin' for me to be po-lite
Let's ask Dr. Dre
That's right bitch (don't hurt me)
That's right bitch (don't hurt me)
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw +IS+ niggaz from Crenshaw
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
When I was growing up they said a Slinky's a wonderful toy
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
Susan an ex-heroin addict who just stopped using
Blow up magic cant take a punch,
Dre'll tell you how I shred
Put in front of your optical to slow you down
I wasn't me, I probably wouldn't wanna play with me neither, shit
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like "Tabitha,
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Roses to violet mollies are blue
that quick
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like...
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Ever since my mother
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
I fuckin' crashed my hovercraft
I've been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
Don't give 'em a demo; kidnap 'em (I want you to come with me)
Brain contusions again
but I don't hear my name No man brought up in rap
Shucka, shucka corn, shucka corn
Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Like my lawyers, when the fuckin' judge lets me off
Ohhhohhh
Ohhhohhh
Ohhhohhh
Ohhhohhh
Ohhhohhh
Ohhhohhh
Ohhhohhh
Ohhhohhh
You're goddamn right bitch, and now it's too late
But I need something to pull me out this dump,
When I'm not even in my harshest
With them short ass arms, like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
In third grade, all I used to do
The connection was the prime suspect
Represents Black Power and we ain't know what it meant
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe.
Of each other being someone else's
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'
Eminem is the synonym for it
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men.
I think of all of the trips to BET
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity 
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing Mr. Officer
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
This chick is clinging on to me sobbing and sighing
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
Afraid I would never find a way o-o-out
Vespucci, I'm a miracle, I'm still super lyrical
You're rodent, I'm omnipotent
Who gives a fuck who they was
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
("What the fuck?!")
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so
even my girls can see I'm grievin',
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci-dently (argghhh!!)
Sometimes I feel so alone,
Sometimes I feel so alone,
Sometimes I feel so alone,
She's only mine for the time being
Today is a painful reminder of why
Now who's the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics?
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
How come I couldn't see this shit myself, it's just me
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
You may think it's 'cause of the way that I was brought up
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
You're probably hear me rap half-hearted; cause I don't like rap anyway
Yeah so what of her?
After hangin out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
I'm tired of life
I just wanna make a few things clear
Fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls
Matter fact, bake me a birthday cake
But you have to
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more
Like my monthly bill from Sprint, they chargin' me for a selfie
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot
There's more music to make
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
Boom boom chuck, Go 'head, funky funk up!
I have the right to remain violent
That ain't the hook, now follow me
But I can't. Why do I act like I'm all high and mighty,
How could I hit a dry spell? (Yeah), I'm named after the wet lands
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
You fuckin' just left me here to die didn't you?
You ain't no motherfucking (bully)
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
Cuz I've been patiently waiting for the day
Talk to me
Shit if I did, itâ€™d be a trailer not a car
You waited this long now stop debating
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Told 'im, "Todd, you're the shit." When's all of this crap end?
Who hard? Yo I done heard worse
Inside him, one foot on the brake one on the throttle
Them good old notorious so well-known tracks
A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's Sha-day!
I might just scoot by and shoot my mum in the neck with rugers
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
Lainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Bang it with a pipe wrench
But you won't break me
But you won't break me
But you won't break me
It better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, lettin' off like Remy Ma
But I'm just here to entertain
But I'm just here to entertain
But I'm just here to entertain
The "Beauty And The Beast", his back is hairy.
I get a reaction from,
Chicka Chicka
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
Iâ€™m still sick, how can I be sick this long
from Obie's penis, she's so deceivin', shit this hoe's a genius, she g'd us...
I said "I'm high too, bitch. Quit grabbing my T-shirt (let go!)
Alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked
'Cause your name I'm beyond sayin'
Momma had a baby and it's head popped off (head popped off
I dunno where I'm goin'
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
I'm out the closet, I been lying my ass off
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge my degrees
Let that little rascal nibble on my asshole
Yeah, I'm happy
Growling from down there
Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Then tell your wife to put your life support on ice
And the final result, back in that same boat
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)
Why your bound notebook got tied around your throat
We probably should run, don't dare look back!
If I catch you sucking another dick
From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
Cut your fucking head off and ask you where you're headed off to,
And when I go to hell and I'm getting ready to leave
Talk a little shit
Didn't have knots, I was so broke
Saying "Don't Disturb", shorty I'm so superb
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?
(Well, I can't just leave Hailie alone. What if she wakes up?)
You're a goner he's onto ya
He's mixing it up for me and Lauren
Choking a bitch to smacking her face from
Ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare
Now y'all are on thin ice
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
So until next time, friends
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...)
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
Her brain matter
To smack a bitch, or say "faggot",
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
(Man, I don't know what's up with these hoes, man)
Extortion, snorting, supporting abortion
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan, yeah!
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
But it's easier to justify
But it's easier to justify
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Just havin' to balance my dang self
(I just wanna be famous).
And you all knew from Meeko
I lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
Snuck up on Malakai and made the motherfuckers suck

Got a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
I looked down and said, "No, I'm not, you're a liar"
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger

This wretched is
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping that you
It made complete sense, there's someone else you like 
Never had no trouble keepin' up with the times
You loved him, didn't you?
You know I got stuff to do
Prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You ask for me?

And I don't mean rap as in a new case of child molestation accusation
To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And interrupt when I'm speaking
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
And rope it shut with a lasso
With a magnum
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
This song isn't for you, it's for me, a true MC

Yes, this beat's takin' me back to my D12 days
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
The king of the playground
It's in your ass, he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too.
Homie you got it backwards, your dippin your soup inside ya crackers
Big Proof, rest in peace dudey, we love you,
Before I begin to get so high; pussy boy, I could spin Fin, fin 
"I think I love you baby"
"I think I love you baby"
"I think I love you baby"
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Sponsors working 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Now I wanna kill her
Crying face emoji, you say this is me without you
Adrenaline's rushing through us just like a geyser gushing
Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Like vice-president Mike Pence
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground
Superman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt
I stay up at night just to say a prayer twice

Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery son
No more.
No more.
So stop that bullshit and flow
The 'cause of my problems
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers
But I want it all
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
Or droppin' a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an ant hill
Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)
Kinda feels like I'm on a whole different page right now than you.
We pass nowhere, we're fearless
Probably rob these little dudes at fist point
I'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me
Nobody wants to play
To awake neighbours for acres
'Cause like Kandor and two, rippin' the condom in two, woo
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it,
I'm so calm through Vietnam, ring the alarm
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)

Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe they'll name me
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'm standing on my Monopoly board
Still, it's no excuse to abuse you
Threaten at the boss, you gon' see me on your porch
There's new rules it's cool if it's helping you to get through
I feel sorry for this beat.
- Are you fucking serious?
(The world's coming to an end, I don't even care)
(The world's coming to an end, I don't even care)
Man if I only had half of it
Don't you never in your motherfuckin' lifeâ€¦
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the

I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
So get the sack of Wisconsin
Alright now I (shit) I just flubbed a line
You fake lyin' slut you never told me you knew Drake
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
They want me to go eat some worms
They want me to go eat some worms
They want me to go eat some worms
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
I think my karma's catching up with me
maybe it bothered me
'Cause if I do that then it opens the door for conversation
My fuckin' wife
The spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Get the paper, man, I'm caking, you know, I don't give a fuck
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
I can prove I'm here to do somethin' you never do, from hand to hand coke sales for my revenue
When will it ever cease for Pete's sakes, he's crazy to say the least
There they go, packing stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Without someone passin' through my sub harassin'
One hundred and eighty degrees in here
Bothers me but not my father, he said Sayonara then split
Dangling from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
"May-back", Maybach
"May-back", Maybach
Which basically goes back to proof & D12
ain't right yet
Fold her in two then sit on her
Twist nothin up like a condom
.. Made it home, later that same day
Girl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal through the uprights
I got a nice pair of dice here
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
Your leader is a botique bitch
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Michael Vick in this bitch, dog fall back you mutts
Shit dissing me is just like pissing off the Wizard of Oz
Now, when it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap
Wait, what was I just about to say?
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
I could lose it at any moment
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
Leg up on the competition
I'm making hits, my homies taking hits, who's staying
I got 'em goin'
I got 'em goin'
I got 'em goin'
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings
Hmm-hmm-hmhmhmmhm.. ahhh, whooooo!! Shit
Who might have a couple of threes,
And you know but you acting like you don't know
And you know but you acting like you don't know
And you know but you acting like you don't know
And you know but you acting like you don't know
And you know but you acting like you don't know
And you know but you acting like you don't know
And you know but you acting like you don't know
Lucky no permanent damage
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
There's an intruder
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls they act retarded
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
A target on my back
Gue, gue-gue-gue, guess who's back
If you fuck me over
When me and Fif got together to do this music
but Smalls don't get down like that
Begin to beat slow, then a breath
They say the competition is stiff
But if you're ho'in
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
I'm 'bout to say "Abracadabra" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
Nothing's riding on it but your pride is all you're fighting for
Revival didn't go viral!
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
At the Ramada Inn, holdin' on to the pill bottle then
In other words I'm off the meat rack
Off of this course, blow me
You should see when I'm stunting, I flash the stones to be wanting
and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock
Of course it is
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to believe
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
"Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!"
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snap
Drop the bomb on them,
Yo we got to get the money man, I can't be broke for the rest of my life
(So, fucked up, right now..)You fucking groupie, pick up the goddamn phone.
It ain't about what you readin
So crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
'Cause I'mma drop the ball if I don't get a grip, hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
You fucking bitch why!?
Have a sound voyage,
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
Have all pretty much parted ways
That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of dukin'
'Cause you could stick a glass on it, it's massive
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored
First name Greatest
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
You only live once
But yeh okay now weâ€™ll talk cause Iâ€™m smack ay
I walk in the crossroad, suicidal tightrope intentionally
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me please?
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are
If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in
Screaming at the sky, 'til clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
Ho thinks her snatch is magical
But then I think about it and I'm enraged
Hand me jack daniel's, spray paintin' the die hard fan
Signs of slowing up, pulling up, blowing up, all over
And I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there
You can even hear the evil spirits comin from within
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Not that I know of, y'all
What?!? I ain't whack nigga, I got some raps for all ya'll
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
My moms got raped by the industry and made me
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
But where was you, when we were fallin' apart
'Cause she's faithfully down
Blackballed and make sure you never rap a fucking again
You little boys can't even fill voids,
The minute that I got a whiff of it
Cause I'm crushin the whole world in my palm
I'm irritated, you 'bout to meet a scary fate
Have a little quick look? - Go on?
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
(Get it)
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
Comin' out the nozzle on the fire hose, flier than swatters?
And you can't stop me from dropping each March
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Come be in Shady's world
Come be in Shady's world
Come be in Shady's world
Come be in Shady's world
Come be in Shady's world
Come be in Shady's world
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Well, that's what they do
Be good or be good at it
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Fat girls
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Which knife and which gun, hat kid, what wife, and which nun
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?
I was gonna make it soon as you said, "Think of Hailie," I knew
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none
(It's like a verbal seduction.)Meet Eddie, twenty-three-years-old
Goal is to get a floozie inside the jacuzzi
She puts the lotion in the bucket, it puts the lotion on the skin
She puts the lotion in the bucket, it puts the lotion on the skin
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
You're the only one that can out my flame
And Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazing than that?
There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
We may blow, no, not even C-P-R from the EMT
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
Until the mannequin doll scatter and the inanimate objects
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be?
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us?
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us?
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us?
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova the show's over, I'm hidin' in Kroger buyin' groceries
So say bye,
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's-notâ€¦ gonna ever
Cause I can't find a decent vein
Shout 'til I throw you out the house,
Drink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers (whoosh)
Although the whole world knows your name
You'll never take my pride
But I'm washing my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold
Shooting from the hip, yeah boy shoot to kill
Who's in the den?
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
I'm just doing my thang, you know the Unit's the game
Third's for the bartender
Since N.W.A. was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
And when it does boy there's a problem,
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
The GOAT just ate eight acres,
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
I still remember the times when
Can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
They can't even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
"It's an accident!"
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within 
Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen
But that's actually
That's why
And there's only two days left of Spring Break
Bitch, you're gonna see
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score
Ya midget, Mini-Me, with a bunch of little Mini-You's
He's still crawling around up there
Cashis,
Game over, Thanos on you H-O's
Which reminded me Biz, "Rockstar" was the shit
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Whaaaaaaaa
'Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (AHH)
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk,
You don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier
Like she thinks I'm dumb
But if you feel like me
Get your desire when I retire
I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathin 
I know and it's my fault!
Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
You are just jealous of me
You are just jealous of me
You are just jealous of me
You are just jealous of me
Hey, wish there was a better way for me to say it,
That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too:
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
I told you you're the apple of my eye, so shut your pie hole
Yeah, now that's love, may sound pathetic
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
So much on my hands I got to give my kids a fist bump
I'm the king of the blood sport on mics
Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Why are expectations so high?
I'm still the one your parents hate
And assemble our own army
May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm
Fan-a-bitch, won't square dance with me
Started thinkin' my name was Fault
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Who the fuck passed you the mic, who the fuck passed you the mic!!
You better unsuck it, you snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again
25 to life
25 to life
25 to life
25 to life
25 to life
25 to life
25 to life
You won't avoid me
This is how we used to make the party start
He makes it look so easy, Girl you just hit the lottery
Yeah this game has got me goin' crazy
I forgot to make amends
I forgot to make amends
I forgot to make amends
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
So I wasn't in no condition to be coaching us through
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
Obie Trice!
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
In one fucking place, finnickin' 'til next Thanksgiving
While I'm tryna keep the lights on
And threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
You are now smoking with the best (the best) 
You are now smoking with the best (the best) 
I'm in the studio, envy
I'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came
In a pair of Sketcher, sweatshirt ripped
They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz?
And I'll be sure to get back
Music's off, party stops
Music's off, party stops
Music's off, party stops
Music's off, party stops
Music's off, party stops
"Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
I'm livin' the dream
Going to bed mad, I keep on trying
'Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Assuming the fact that dudes in the back room
Back in the day when I met Dre
Back in the day when I met Dre
Back in the day when I met Dre
Back in the day when I met Dre
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
People start to show up, time to start the show up
Buy you ice
But Shady's cute, Shady knew, Shady's dimples would help
And leave this crazy world
But every time we hear you kick it 
And as you say goodbye to the grief
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
I fuck the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
People are still camped out from the night before
So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
But there's always another side to a good father
But there's always another side to a good father
I may never trust someone
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
But I smoke dope in a cab
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang
Can't escape the madness
Yeah, it's kinda like we're tryna light a dynamite stick
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Looking over my shoulder,
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
When I joke about leavin'
Love that tattoo, what's that say?"
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do,
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do,
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do,
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do,
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do,
Seduction, seduce. Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do,
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
Only gut you had was from your stomach fat
Then open it up while the shit's inside ya
For all the weed that I've smoked - yo this blunt's for you
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Which now reminds me
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed
But how do you get the shit beat outta you, beat down and be upbeat, when you don't have nothing?
Let's see if you can fit your feet
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route 
For destruction, the fucking recipe for disaster
You're the Slim to my Shady
A great one 
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos from seance to seance
Imagine a visual for that man
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
Too late
Too late
What I do, through and through
P.S.
What has ended up happening, a tragedy
It just becomes everyday extra-curriculum
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
Raise the concerto while I narrate
Feeding you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss
Hits a snare and bass in a track for duck rapper interrogation
So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
But one of us in this relationship is raising the other
you know what I'm saying?
you know what I'm saying?
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
I said I'm a candle, I go out if you blow on me
Party's over kids, kill the noise,
Beating himself in the head, 'til Russell lets him off Def Jam
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice
It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Whoops, somebody shot me!
but this time they got fucking auto-ma-tic
Throw your spine out of alignment
When it spins, when it swirls
"Yo Sue!"
Wagin wars, went on stage and sprayed cage with (agent orange)
Yeah I been told no but it was more like, "No, no, no!!!"
That's all they say, looking boy
And I won't quit
Do-si-do
All the times that you threw it back at me,
I'm the light at the end of tunnel
Driving up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
You were using me for loot like I used you for looks
Top five, I'm where the legends are (Keep goin')
Having this happening (this happening)...
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing about her
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem.
You know I got you open kid, stop fronting
This flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop
So what?
So what?
the monotony
And most of all be advised that he's wise
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi, single
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you than to count the things that are.
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
I just remembered that I'm absent minded
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Save it bitch, babysit
I'm rewinding the tape
We're the ones who made you!
We're the ones who made you!
We're the ones who made you!
We're the ones who made you!
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
Come on we're going for a ride, bitch
Just dust, back on the stage, give me my microphone
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
But you're the one thing that I would die for
But you're the one thing that I would die for
They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
And I won't hesitate
Never be as good, never be as good
Never be as good, never be as good
Never be as good, never be as good
This bitch can twist like a damn contortionist
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Flooded with thoughts of anger
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole
Missed who he's aiming for six feet away's the door
I was taught if you're gonna murder somebody you should face em
and that's when accidents happen,
Shady and entertaining from real life
Right in the ass with KY, yes sir!
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it
No matter what...
So once a year or twice a month I'm here if you want it
Yeah boy shake that ass

I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
Man, I hate this crap, this ain't rap
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas on my plate
Excusez-moi but that coochie that passed
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots!
Uh I'm cumming
Just imagine the fun I can have with a strap on,
So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you wizzass
Yo, why does it always sound like I'm grabbing my nostrils?
Time to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds
Man, boy's got to look
Stole her car, made a profit
It went a little something like
Oh man, how can I describe the way I feel?
It's above and beyond us
Bitch, you ain't plugged in to nothin'
"So am I too!
And flip it upside down
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
Yeah I hear what your saying,
It's cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese

when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
We're tussling, the crowd's starting to cheer us and
chicka chicka chicka ..
Me go, pillow drenched
And sucking dick and that's it (I said it)
Detroit!
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And got the rep of a villain
who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?"
Let insults fly every sixty seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
How her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
Girl, girl, girl,
Girl, girl, girl,

Hell with PlayStation, I'm still on my first man on some Zelda
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
Elite beat boxer minus the raps

Got a twisted sense of humour, it's warped, but I didn't hit you
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smoke
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now

Shit this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
"You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad.
They try to shut me down on MTV
So the walls and I done lost my power to see through them bitches

'Til her vocal chords were swelling and her voice was more horser than Tori Spellings' face
Hahaha! Gimme the mic, let me recite, 'til Timothy White
I armed like an octopus
Never been a more compelling case, than the model covered in L'Oreal and Mace
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Mosh pits outside the Oval Office
(Aren't you a male dancer?) Nah bitch, I'm retired
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Biting into a fucking Vicadin like I'm a viking
Was that I had developed a crush
Have some threesome
But none return, when will they learn?
But none return, when will they learn?
But none return, when will they learn?
But none return, when will they learn?
Over 80 million records sold
Crazy insane or insane crazy?
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
It's an amazing task to battle with success
Miss those times now when I was just starting out
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
Get at me, dog
And let's go
You can get the dick, just call me the ballsack, I'm nuts
I spit the illest shit, ever been dropped in two-inch
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
So I never say, "Goodbye, cruel world."
Shorty on some whole 'notha other shit
Shove it up my butt
I don't wanna play games, no games, ah
for me to raise such a stink up
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
But this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
I show you every inch grows of my foreskin 
I'll never love again
I'll never love again
"I remember it clearly, even today."
You'll be safe for days
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Give you a shoutâ€”now get the fuck out my rhyme book!
Fuck the guns, i'm done, i'll never look at gats
It's funny
You think of my name now whenever you say hi
Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC's heart
"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?"
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
I bust shots, they bust back
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde, it's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20â€²s still
Today's a whole new chapter
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
That's the mentality here (here) that's the reality here (here)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed you?
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
You hit me once and that I would use
I'll meet you down there
Forever young.
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo,
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
When I stole the show (ha), sorry if I took forever (haha)
when suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
Come on, get out
And there's really nothin else to say (but umm)
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
Got your gal blowing up a valve, valve-valve
league or the room with of the people
The press blows up this whole thing, it's stupid
(Yes!)
(Yes!)
Just as soon as I walk in
On this game will end, I'm loco
While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
I just deal with the hate I receive, I rollin' back my sleeves, ? show other bree with bran wrapped to
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
This is about as cookey as I've ever felt now
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
I don't wanna go on
I don't wanna go on
I don't wanna go on
I don't wanna go on
I don't wanna go on
I don't wanna go on
While I stomp mudholes in ya ass girl,
He'll fucking flip on yaYeah, girl.
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
At Mayweather's pad singin' to a man
shit, from these bitches on our dicks, fucking chickens with no ribs, that's why I ain't got no
I'm the one who burned your house down, well I'm out now
You know, you acting like you don't know
You know, you acting like you don't know
You know, you acting like you don't know
You know, you acting like you don't know
You know, you acting like you don't know
You know, you acting like you don't know
You know, you acting like you don't know
You know, you acting like you don't know
Drag her across the ground
Smile pretty for pictures
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics)
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics)
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics)
That you slept on, son
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know
I told you why I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did you?
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hacking 'em up with that
Under ones and twos, threes and four (the morning)
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies
Looking like I got in a fucking pillow fight with a triple fat goose
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac
I'm thinkin' soon as trampolines so we should bounce
(But who are you?)
When you're me
But just like a girl who thinks her coochie doesn't stink
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
Just wanna be normal
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
You pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!
Or end up in my next rhyme
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
fucka-fucka-fuck off!
And perform "Fack" in concert
Clack
Don't mean to ruin your plans
Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home, man
As the World Turns
As the World Turns
And I'm in trouble, but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
Look it's B.Rabbit!
Hug the floor while we playing tug-of-war with your life
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Cut him up into pieces and just when I went to drink his blood
Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
But don't you place the blame on me
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
You know you want me baby
You know you want me baby
You know you want me baby
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Please don't do this, baby
That's daddy's baby
So this year, I'm goin' to the fifth and I'm tall
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
I was happy having a deal at first
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
she needs all the publicity she can get
I'm so sick and tired of being admired
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Sometimes I play possum
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
So am I-a, wooh, Cappadonna, cut the track off (fart sound)
I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just
It's juvenile, delusional, as usual
But I done did enough Codeine to knock future into tomorrow
Guess I'm a prisoner, see, addiction is a disease
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfucking ho's
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
'Till I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
Party popping shawty says she coming with me tonight
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ, each day is an Instant Replay
The wife who never divorced me.
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
But there's always tomorrow still
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
When they ain't buttoned up right, I adjust on the fly
If the the ball in my hand then the ball in the net
Daddy will be home soon
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots to rap
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Yo, mic check
I said shut up when I'm talking to you
So this is it...
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
Insanity, can it be vanity, where is the humanity
So when they bust you better bust back 
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic
When you push your body on mine, oh my
When you push your body on mine, oh my
When you push your body on mine, oh my
Can't knock bein' Rudolph, so fear not my deer
hearse, so you paranoid at every little cold that you get, ever since they told you this shit,
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets, {yeah})
And I'm always game, so keep it a hundred, dear, haha
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
Drove in thru somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
This bitch don't know what abortion is
Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
No, you think I'm ugly
WE NOTHING BUT SOLDIERS!!!
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Judge be like "That's sharp, how much did that motherfucker cost you?
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes
Sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk in Target and look at shit Browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show"
You ain't gonna make me cum
Ha, bitch you get (no love, no, no love, no, no love)
Ha, bitch you get (no love, no, no love, no, no love)
We don't got nothin' in common (no)
We don't got nothin' in common (no)
Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right 
Both got hundreds of charges
Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter
Nobody will fuckin' test me 'cause these hos won't even dare
The demented side of a mind
I've been to the muthafuckin mountain top
Somebody you would give a lung to be hungry
And I go grab my go-go-gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress
So he's like my competition
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
And it became my cocaine
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
It's Shady on the lyrics
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
And I believe
You know the aim is to bang you
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your bodyAnother day, another hotel, the inside of it's nice though
Letters written that we coulda read
So let's go back
So let's go back
So let's go back
At all so don't grow partial
Bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
Top of his lungs, but ain't no stoppin' me from choppin' him up... up
But every day is a new learning curve as you
Until my legs
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313
I thrive off of danger, jumping in all beef
To my partners, I can't say how sorry I am
Your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed
About the crap
See, it's sad it came to this point
And get the soap, and try to get the Pope to hold me
But it's like I can't uncap it 'cause it's childproof
I could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to Detroit
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
And while you flaunt 'em I could be taking them to shops to pawn them
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
They call me the fruit loop from jupiter,
Throw down the cardboard
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good!
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can KISS MY ASS
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
'Cause I'm a renegade. Never been afraid to holler
'Cause I'm a renegade. Never been afraid to holler
'Cause I'm a renegade. Never been afraid to holler
Now I hope you don't get mad at me
I will not budge, so what the deal ridaz?
Welfare recipient since a minor
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (Brrr)
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
Chubba chubba chubba chubba chubba chubbie
Student of the game pre-Kane, you niggas Post Malone
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
The way I knock em outta they shoes
You were supposed to love me
Or maybe you did
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles 
Some people ask me, where Iâ€™ve been lately
Some people ask me, where Iâ€™ve been lately
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
At one thing and so fucked at a whole nother
Let's try another room
You're addicted I'm dope
And smearing her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
And that's why
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you."
Yeah, you think you the shit, till we flush you
Fuck dropping the jewel, I'm flipping the sacred treasure
Kiss my butt, my set of principles is gone
With speakers knockin it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc then proceed to drop
Evaluation fuck Jason it's Friday the 19th
"But Shady, we were meant for each other.
Ghan got me cross eyed like Bernstein's son
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
Mister fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants parasail
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it
With real life when the music stops
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
Yo.. yo yo yo yo
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
About six cars back, I'm in the lac
Who would the odds favor?
Me that matters now's DeShaun
'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage
And sell a mil or grow up to be Attila
Until the roof
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
Far at other peoples' expenses
I'm an MC still as honest
So she's been on the web lately
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
Hide and roam into the masses, without boundaries
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
Said can I take you home, where we can be alone?
So, baby, don't feel no pain
So, baby, don't feel no pain
So, baby, don't feel no pain
So, baby, don't feel no pain
So, baby, don't feel no pain
So, baby, don't feel no pain
But now the medications taken over
You fuckers are not ready, 'cause I got jelly like (Beyonce's) pot belly
Renegade! Never been afraid to say
Renegade! Never been afraid to say
Renegade! Never been afraid to say
While I sashayed around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
Pants or dress
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
I swung it hard as I could at his head
Is it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
We could've... Hey! Where you going? Get back here!
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
Concentrated like orange juice so I'm not as diluted
Sawing off a fuckin' body limb
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe theyâ€™re just tryna distract it
Demonic sinister, ever since the Doc replenished me
And follow you while you drive home
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
That I startled my mom and had her scared to death
Don't think I'm loyal
Cause if you ain't tilting this room, neither am I
Then I said
And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him
And Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
I step, strapped with a pen
And I'm not chillin' the fuck out
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
Fuck this mirror!
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt 'cause
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
Guess that the best thing I could do right now, Doody, for you is to rap
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
And Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
(Nitro) Hi ho, Silva
to throw her off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force and I don't wanna resort to
What is life?
What is life?
Somebody's licking shots off
Somebody's licking shots off
Somebody's licking shots off
Somebody's licking shots off
Can't get a fuckin' word in, edgewise (Shut up)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off
Such a beautiful relief
Such a beautiful relief
Such a beautiful relief
I'mma work for everything I have
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
He just had front-row seats told me to sign his poster then insults me
Furious four motherfuckers
Go nuts and be a killer
Holten in this bitch, I'm the Proof boy your a fraud,
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
I call my Mercedes a Benzo
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
I have infinite hate in my blood
I have infinite hate in my blood
You want me to tell you something?
Please don't upset me, mama, you're looking sexy, mama
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
If you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)
Like I'm asleep it's awesome
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
Ya I know
Game of love, love, love, love, la-la-la-la-la love
Of his career typical manure moving past that
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine-year-old construction worker
And can't listen to "Arose" without cryin'
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
And that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that
It's already fucked and I'm on top.
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
Much as I fight to restrain
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
We're only looking forward, but
Like I want that... I'm not looking for extra attention
And where is G-Unit at, they like (We over here)
Who hid behind the freedom of speech
It's your bitch on my dick. Ain't my dang fault. Man, I can't call it...
Got a blowjob from paula jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head, Bust a nut, get some rest
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
These haters is so pussy theyâ€™re afraid to be scared
You tryin' to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you, you say
Boy/girl groups make me sick
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
I'd like to treat ya to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
What they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio, meh
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm
They came to see you spit your game
So pass it like a hot potato
when I was chasin' the a fey at 18, 8 years later his voice in Beijing
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackenin'
(Yo can you sign this right here?)
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
You ain't gonna make or break me
Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything
You're thinkin' just cause you came in with scrubs
Wiped you and powdered you.
I feel like God broke the vials and I am just layin' down inside 'em like caulk and tile
Plus we don't say how we feel
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
I'd roam the streets so much they'd call me a drifter
You better lick the fucking plate, you ain't wasting it
But its all right, its ok with me,
So buck the Buddha, light a bong
Never writer's block, I block writers
Just escaped from the state pen
And when I awake I'm like Dre
Settle your fucking ass down I'm ready for combat, man
You really fucked me, Kim
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
Hope it lands on another rap singer's lips
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left
Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left
Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left
I don't want to die yet
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
If she ain't planning to do shit, this summers eve
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
Twice, the magic that started it all
We're not pretending to beef, don't cost a penny to be with me
yellin' at an old lady to 'Touch my body!'"
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
Jabba the Hutt, beddy-bye-bye
Got to the crib she let me in
And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn)... and the heroin
So here's a toast to federal checks
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I'm confused
Stiffen up that upper lip
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Cause when we descend together, we begin to move as one
Tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears
Its like these people are steps now, all they do is stare
I was layin' in bed last night thinkin' and this thought just popped in my head
I was layin' in bed last night thinkin' and this thought just popped in my head
I was layin' in bed last night thinkin' and this thought just popped in my head
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick
So, won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
So, won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
Think I might be about to busta, bust her, the thought's scary yo, though and it hurts-brace
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
All combined into one, I don't walk a line, bitch, I run
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt chin
You talk a lotta shit, but you was never ill though
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face I'm insane
You better set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot
No stopping the force, Obi
Just to make a dollar off of black music
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
M.A
With a wire hanger then digest her
My views ain't changed still Inhumane
Because everybody knows
I'll be your savior from all the wars that are fought
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
(Oh, oh, yeah) Yeah
That's why it's at a stalemate
Such passion, you'd expect this sort of reaction from her. Yet, you strong arm.
but take a look at my family
From your persona
Tired of not being on tour
Look how excited, I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
So everybody, everybody
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends"
It's challenging but my conscience allows me to think
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
I'm in the booth popping another pill tryna talk myself into it
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested
White trash with a half a six pack in his hatchback
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin ass every night, Ike
But no way they can see in though (Nah)
So, I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
Who'd have thought a country-wide tour'd be the outcome
Leave hand prints all across you
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me.
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick it's Bizarre
And I been thinkin' bout the time I slept on the floor at the outhouse
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Don't you know what felch means? (yeah), well then tell me Would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Gets goin' she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
take a look at what I've done
That the horses come out erra
Lamping in my K-Mart mansion, I'm in the style department
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Someone had to make the sparring end
They're talking bad about Dad, it's ticking me off too
The wrong button to push
We established this way before we became mates
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Oh! Lightning is striking, oh might be a fucking sign, not like I need a psychic
If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun
They knew I did it (uh-huh) for havin blood on my 'gators
So my supplies infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier
I give you a JFK on the front lawn of MLK in the crossfire (Get down, nigga)
And you was like, (sampled) **I need a new nigga** 
And Madonna with mud on her, God dammit I am misogynist
I feel a passionate lust when I'm imagining just us alone at last with a 
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
Gue-gue-guess who's back (Hi mom!)
It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
No, I told you, leave me the fuck alone, will you?
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
I know it's confusing you
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
'Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go, fight his own war
But Denaun's right behind him squeezing his four-fifth
But this one's perfect, 'cause I'mâ€”
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
Singin' fuck all of you in Autotune
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
Earth links how do you like these you gotta love them
Both robbed of our mothers
Now let's go hit the mall, y'all know that we finna ball
Fuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
But I'll probably always keep on playin'
Mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth.
Listen kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear
Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are Kryptonite
Ever since I came along
I double-edge sword it 'cause one place I poke and
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
You got a couple of ghost writers
I wanna make songs all the fellas dub
and like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best
I must have got my pimping genes from him, the way he left my mama
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
I feel like I'm walking a tight rope, without a circus net
I couldn't do it all without you
Gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink oink oink
He ain't so hot now is he?
Yeah, baby we hopeless, don't we make an atrocious
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
You won't find anywhere, where it fires and I unload my pen explodes
Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up
Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up
Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up
All I hear is lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy,
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
Cause this time girl,
And now he's acting like a bully
I'll always love ya
Oh yeah, I bar at will
And I know they're gonna hate
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
Told you how to slap dicks and murder your girl (I did!)
Where the President would go for a little friday stroll
Fack I just came again
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
And no matter how much
And I ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers
To give a sub-par bar, even have an opinion or view
And forever we can drag this on and on
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
(haha) alright, look
And we are Americans
And we are Americans
Oh no I won't leave
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
you wanna pop, shit wake-up, then make-up
Yeah, what the deal?
Love, Daddy, maple flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
What up dog?
I'm a alcoholic with the fucking toilet
Pass up on that little cute chick right there that'll be pretty damn stupid of me
Iâ€™m back in ya hair, sorry for leavinâ€™ you stranded
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch"
I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
Enough holding back the steam, Em let off a magazine
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
Run myself in the ground, 'fore I put some wack shit out
Came out with a little scratch, ooh
I got that whole block lookin' like it's Candyland
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
Didn't want you to know I was struggling
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
But you just a wannabe gunna (gang!)
you done witnessed
Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
I guess we would have to walk a mile
Psych, I joke, I joke, I keed, I keed
Psych, I joke, I joke, I keed, I keed
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Cause I'm scared there's monster's under my bed,
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
Mosh with me now!
Now where's your poop birds?
I got that old rum-pum-pum-pum
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark
And never go away, until our dying day
friends until Isaac
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fucking night's just begun
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Every time we fought, the insults, they gotâ€¦ thrown too far
Don't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6
And I can say that and you'll laugh 'cause there's a puppet on my hand
Flash back to september 7th
Yeah, like that
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea and be free
And you'd see why I be this way
It's 1-800-I'm a dick sucker I love to suck a dick
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs
Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict
As he use his magazines to trash me
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
It feels so wrong cause it feels so right,
Oh, my god, I love you
(Kuniva you alright)
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'
Alright Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'
Lay off and stay off
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to 'bust a rhyme'
Who needs bullets
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not've made it through?
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
The Thing ain't even orangeâ€”oh my God, that's a reach!"
And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business, kid"
You stare into your stereos high
You better think of the consequence
Single filing up in the stack
But no one but us knew we were beefin'
We could try to make another "Blair Witch-a - movie"
You're sealed in but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
My dog thinks so too, look at my predigree
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
"Ha!, Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, God damn"
Fella's (WHAT?!) Fella's (WHAT?!)
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
Who the fuck is you pushin', you must've mistook me for some sissy
Drinking Lysol
And I'm not gonna let 'em treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter
'Cause it's over and it's closure
like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool (Woo!)
2010!
60 sluts, all of them dying from asphyxia
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
You a bark, bitch, and never bite, long kiss goodnight
Go get your crew to hype you up stand behind you like whoooo!
That the crook just took over so book
Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!"
Let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt 
Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to see why you feel upset
Cuz if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed
(I'm a goat)
(I'm a goat)
(I'm a goat)
You take my breath away
Why you're back but don't rap the same
I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
See children, drugs are bahhhd (that's right)
And eat shit while they at it
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I should fly south, 'cause man am I great, ain't lyin' to myself
death live in me, I take life through the pen by the way I'm see I'll have you raped in the pen, like
and twist the necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
A lot of people think.. that I worship the devil..
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
(Baby)
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
Though we might get along like shit
'Cause I'm raising the bar
To think it was you at one time I worshiped, shit
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing's the matter with me
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
So, god damn... is it that time again already
I guess this is the most dramatic I've been in a while
Indivisible with liberty and justice for all...
(Say peace to McVay and me and this chick take off like a sick day)
Because too much of you's just too much to swallow sometimes
You just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap
Oh fuck yeah
Bitch or man
(Look at that bitch! Ha, yeah!)
Cause nobody's body's awesomer, I lust it and she loves me
I once encountered a stranger
Brewster Projects nigga
erra Oh Oh Ah Ah
erra Oh Oh Ah Ah
erra Oh Oh Ah Ah
See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
But you'll grow into them, baby, I'm on the grind now
And as she flew around the room like a balloon
I just wanna get that across
what it was was
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Pretty apparent, she's a M.I.L.F. when blowin' me
I'm a conniving (What?), when I'm on the mic I'ma standout
My need I stay strangling
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
I like birds, bees, I like people
Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit...
Only bull you should take is by the horns
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
How'm I supposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
(bitch bring me a bottle of Mo')
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
What's that that's attracting us to each other?
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
Off what? Off the feel of going in
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
While Iâ€™m sittinâ€™ back in my office jackinâ€™ off to my plaques
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
And I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster
I run the streets and act like a mad man holdin' a glad
before she get's kicked in the stomach, and she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me
I've calmed down now -- I was heavy once into drugs
I'm right back on 'em, with the
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
And although one has only met their grandma once
You last went and threw your hat in the race
MCs, blood get spilled and I'll
I went to grab my gun
Iâ€™m a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanyeâ€™s glasses!Yeah.
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggas?
staring back to see who's mugs
I almost lost it
I almost lost it
Cause that's it
they said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out
No boundaries, no lengths
I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin I was bound to work a number on your back and
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
Cause I'm a...
And DJ Head
So fuck it, I'ma start right here I'll just be brief I'm
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
'Cause, yes...
But
And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
No offense? Yes offense, precedents has been set that'll never get met
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
You faggots are all gonna do my bidding
Like changing a lightbulb
Be a man, stand. A real man would've had this shit handled.
But we as entertainers
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
And some real enjoyment
Your da-da loves you
Your da-da loves you
Attention all units, attention all units
Bitch, I'm coming out swinging, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
All this terror America demands action
What I do though for good
I hear my music box playing a song for me.
I hear my music box playing a song for me.
I hear my music box playing a song for me.
He ain't even go to class Bueller
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
To represent my temperment
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
'Til I snap
Your host for the evening (Marshall!)
To spaz with the pen, I'm a little bit sicker than
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac
For four hours and you just said, "No"
Fuck you, Ms. Cheney,
Man, in my younger days
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention
Wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad threw it back and
This is your song
This is your song
This is your song
This is your song
I'd still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
Shit half a Vicodin, why can't I?
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
Life is stressful inside this cesspool 
Then I'ma split, disappear, a cloud of smoke is all you see
Are you ready? - You better hold the camera steady.
You look impeccable, nothing compares
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
With all the pictures that I draw of
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
Still blows my mind show
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
Geez, I just got my seat
Light years ahead of you, ha ha.
Have homosexual sex
Rigor mortis and post mortem
'Cause the way I see people turning's
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
Fuckin' bitch
from other players in this game? on the surface, it may
I started to inhale it
Probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
I notice there's so many of 'em
I notice there's so many of 'em
I notice there's so many of 'em
I notice there's so many of 'em
This is the winner takes it all
This is the winner takes it all
This is the winner takes it all
This is the winner takes it all
And tomorrow I'll probably still be too high to get outta bed
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze
But if I offended you? Good
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
juice, the womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock in that spot hotter than the
Let me know when it occurs to you
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit
Probably sayin, "He ain't a killer", but I'm killin myself
I start to bug prick, you better flee 'cause I get ticked
But you dimes won't get a fucking nickle from me
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
I think of all the shit I had to go through
It doesn't work
If I could just get over this hump
Oh shit, the shooter's comin'
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear
These damn rhymes are fallin' outta my pants pocket, I can't stop it
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Practicin' trash talkin'
But Detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
Call me extra, extra terrestrial (Yeah)
Call me extra, extra terrestrial (Yeah)
Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
Kidnapping your mom cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery
Start pissing and do the opposite on you

Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I

Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
(Drunk off tragic endings)Yo, how do I keep
whore, what would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce, she's havin' another baby
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
I sound like I'm tryna sing the fucking chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray"?
Could start a revolution
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowin' ya Norman
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Run out of excuses for everyone
Run out of excuses for everyone
When the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
(My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live)
(My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live)
I'm hoping things will look up
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
Let go
Rhyming is all we ever wanted to do
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
We'll be right back
Where does that leave me? Well I guess that I'm between predominantly
I'm over respected, my mama gated community's over protective
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby
You may be gone but you're never over
You may be gone but you're never over
You may be gone but you're never over
And the balls in my court and it's lonely
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
'Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
Fuck you, Debbie!
Where the fuck you were at
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
Do you still believe in me?
Do you still believe in me?
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't, 'cause I'd probably be Dahmer, 'cause mama always said...
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Shady let go, the hoe has been choked up enough
All about my dough but I don't even check the peep-hole
Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I'm losin' control
I'm losin' control
I'm losin' control
red on the ceilin, red on the floor, get a new whore
Like oak wood was burning
so now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass white rapper show, right
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
For any excuse to just cut loose
For any excuse to just cut loose
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
I look at my life in a new light -- fuck it
huggin' me four minutes ago at the door, man, i'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this
It was worth it cause he changed became so observant
It was worth it cause he changed became so observant
When they know they're your heart
An eighth of that was just to make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Yeah the man's back
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Women all grabbin at my shishkabob
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
Come here!
When I see them, you hoes ending up in a fuckin mausoleum
Money outweighing problems on a triple beam
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uhh
So one more time for old time's sake 
I can hold you in the morning
I can hold you in the morning
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
I try to look alive because there's nothin' like holdin'
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit
and his eyes roll back in his skull {*blblblblblb*} 
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
Rest of these youngins of mine
Here's confirmation
Guilty, 'cause I sparked a revolution
With a pile in my cart, ripping the aisle apart
If I had a time machine
(chk chk) What's my name? Shady came to crush the game
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch 
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
Now a new day is dawning
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
The line that's hot, that I forgot
(Whats your name?) Shady
One-hundred percent finished
Nigga, and you can't replace the late great one
Bet'chya ya flinch when proof shoot up they crew
I'll never forget what that feeling was like I,
Hey ho, hey ho
The target is you.
Can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I struggle with this shit every single day and um...
Dre said, "Hold your head up!"â€”Kathy Griffin
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
I grew up on WICâ€”wick, wick, wickâ€”with a short fuse
Even if I'm under the gun
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
(I'm a) true warrior, got the plug like Trugoy
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
I couldn't even see the millimetere when it fell
A flawed human, I guess
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
But what comes around goes around (yeah, yeah)
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
She jumps off 'Wee-Bey' from the Wire's dick now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Cursing at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
So please don't make me some type of hero
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
Break bread while I'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
When I stumbled upon this resolution
But because I'm hungry. She smells like Tacos I wanna eat.
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
You're standing adjacent to Jason, slash, Leatherface, and
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
(I'm back) I'm back
(I'm back) I'm back
(I'm back) I'm back
(I'm back) I'm back
(I'm back) I'm back
(I'm back) I'm back
Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
And put our minds more at ease
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
All these females need to email to make noise
Pasted, blasted, puke, drink up, get a new drink
You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that
Without him and be proud of where we're from
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
In my left hand, I hold mic stand
Maybe one day when the smoke clears it won't be as
Yes I do sir, what am I on?
A subconscious racist
â€“tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
"I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
Just when you thought you were safe
You were the glue that binded
Lay here and die in your arms
'Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Rude Jude, I go there, you wouldn't
Columbian neck tie
Through the tall grass, run your ass off (Yeah)
But I know magic and here go my last trick
Mission accomplished
My fuckin bitch mom's suing for ten million
Bury my face in comic books, cause I don't want to look
The more it makes me wanna come back to you,
I'm so slap happy man, snap me back to reality,
Coming home with me
Least I know that I don't know
This is my goodbye, farewell
This is my goodbye, farewell
This is my goodbye, farewell
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon who entered me
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again!
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
By the time they hit fourth grade
If it's true, if it's you, what you say in your raps, what you do
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick
And, yes, I mean eating a penis
I ever meet my match, I'mma strike that bitch first
I felt horrible about myself
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
So lonely and cold.
To these kids you no longer exist
I've accomplished they stomped me into the mud, gee for what reason? You stumped me
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
So violets are blue, roses are red
You dream of trading places,
You dream of trading places,
You dream of trading places,
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
I'm leaving Heaven (Yeah)
Shake your booty shorty I'm the shit
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down
But I handle my business cause it's work before play
Somehow, MCs ain't that eyebrow-raising to me
Their souls for this rap game and it goes
But fuck it I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
May be gone, but he's not forgotten
Out sold the sell-outs, freak the hell out Middle America, hear 'em yell out, in terror they were so scared and those kids
If I was frozen inside of a moment
"We are the underground empire."
Feel like I'm burning to death, but I'm freezin'
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-elope would be dope
Stuck in an awkward place in my life
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But she don't care, they're attractive, very
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Just recently somebody just discovered
Pump my gas, cut my grass, I can't take out the fuckin' trash
Oh Amy!
NWA said "Fuck the Police," now I'm in jail
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway
To me they're just ink blots
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
This may be the only opportunity that I got
Through the back door slipping through the crack
It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!
I like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble
And I don't know what's got a hold of me
It's like all eyes on me
Break out Berettas, lay down in bed and blow our brains out together
Bandwagoners, I'm kicking the damn stragglers off and I'm strangling 'em
With a chain saw to cut me out
(But I don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve)
(But I don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve)

The bar for me what I rap isn't fair but
I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
So full of joy, boy am I absurd
Well I'mma tell 'em
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
Getting this stress that's been eating me recently off of this chest
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why not?)
Eminem I'm coming to kill you
"And the next thing I know something came crawling up from below
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
But still as explosive with, just load the clip
Your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear
You flowers got no clout with a thing
I was chasinâ€™ the dragon, I dont know what happened
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas
(It's one of those kinda nights)
You can be black, white or a albino yeah
Just what the doctor ordered
Should I look in the mirror?
In the beginning, friends we decided to roll
Bobby creek is in the place
Talk to me, sit. Here, pull up a chair.
Suddenly I'm not crazy
Suddenly I'm not crazy
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Flip burgers and wash dishes while I wrote rhymes tryna get props for 'em
Ha, bitch you get (no love, no, no love, no, no love, no, no love)
Ha, bitch you get (no love, no, no love, no, no love, no, no love)
("Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?")
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
My, my stepdad
My, my stepdad
Fuck slitting her throat, cut this bitch's head off!
This ain't your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny
Kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation
Out the corner of his cornea he just saw you run
But he's just a friend (evil twin),
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
Pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn

And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
It's the motivation that keeps me going
It's the motivation that keeps me going
It's the motivation that keeps me going
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
(Ah!)
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl inside of a
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters
You may not think you do, but you do
You may not think you do, but you do
You may not think you do, but you do
Unghh, school flunky, pill junky
Don't blame me 'cause you washed up, lost your spot
Don't blame me 'cause you washed up, lost your spot
I can feel these curtains closin'
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
Have to step in every once in a while to save me
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
'Cause it's only one percent
But I'm only going to get this one chance
And Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
It ain't even worth dissing someone so offbeat
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
This definitive, just need you, talking bout I live and breathe you
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
Down a fifth, crack open a six
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (Animals)
But keep over achievin'
Stacking them crates up 
Another punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk
Sipping a can of penzoil
You make elevator music
During an earthquake, urine in your face
Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun 
I'd rather wallow than bask, suffering succotash, but the ant-
not the only one who's off his rocker
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' 'im
She told me yo Shady just hand your penis to me I'll deep throat
as soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
Suck it Marshall
Going nowhere fast.I sense someones tapping into my phones why do
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wrecking the house
She's been stolen from you...
Girl forget remorse, I'mma hit you broads
And how ironic, that I'd be the bad guy
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan
With some floaties on
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game
I always find you like this
the black sheep of the family what a bad seed I
If I scrap, i'll scrap like I ain't never whooped some ass
Those are your wounds this is the salt
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
We're applying, but McDonald's
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I latch onto you like aâ€”parasite
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
'Fore I sit back and let him get hotter
So quit tryna play the wall like you Paul
I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
And let it go to whoever's holding the most current beef on their shoulders
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
Talk a little spit on my ding-a-lang
You don't got the tools, I got my toolkit
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
When I pull up looking for you with a pistol
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
And what's a little fight?
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope,
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
Points a finger at me (finger at me)...
You got the point when I cleverly said it
When your situation showed no improvement
Kanye, keep ya head up,
The last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
There's several different levels to Devil worshippin: horse's heads,
All your bars subpar like good golfers

"It's too late, Dad, you made your choice.
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
From the hood and I'm a hornet
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
I mean I really want ya bad, you cunt
Started causing a scene
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
Do you have a daddy?
Yo, yo
An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it
It's Friday night came to this bitch right
I've got no game
I should download her audio on MP3
She's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun
I'm hanging it up, fuck it
When on eggshells I was made to walk
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
You left me off your list
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
So, Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (yeah)
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old 
You thought I left you, now why would I do that? (1, 2, 3)
All the shit you been put through this feeling of resilience is building
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
The date's today
Keep movin'
Yeah you laugh 'til your motherfuckin' ass gets drafted
I never knew my father neither
Tired of not being a millionaire
But have guns for sure, you better put a
Tap-dancing all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Legacy, legacy, eh
It's Swifty from the 313
Back into the game and they know
Come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
In this gourde there's a Ford engine, door hinge, syringe, an orange an extension cord and a ninja sword
Holy toledo it's Angelina Jolie amigo
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
You did this to us
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid?
And all women ain't shit
Guess it comes with the territory
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
We as a Americans

I said my head is twisted like a bread tie (Yup)
Leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs.
Fuck it I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
'Cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars
Like you should fuckin' beat it or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
I belong here, clown, don't tell me 'bout the culture
My name is Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes

To tiny drops, little drips
This is how I shot ahead (pew)â€”Gabby Giffords
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
to wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
And at the time every house that we lived in
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
You niggaz still don't know the top pick?
For loving and leaving, you all I'm thinking of in the evening
Boy I'm Michael Spinks with the belt,
Cause I feel like the night won't end til I get finished
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbin' groins with

Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wildin'
Just to hear you keep screaming for me to seep it
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause

Yo', never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
And you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked
And if the plane goes down
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century I'm just numb.
He looked at me like I'm out my mind shook his head like, "White boys don't know how to rhyme."
Yes it is, hey Busta didn't come here did he?
Which only sets off a chain reaction
But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers, claims he had it
But life keeps on complicating, and I'm debating
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
How could I be so naive?
Sometimes I just feel like my father,
And you know you were their armour
Too upset, it's just too much mess
And don't take shit, give it!
I'll just keep saying the same exact saying, check it
'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
I know look, I'm trying to get rich,
Let your low-end raise, yo
In a safe, locked them away
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
I'm actually buzzin' this time
and I'm not a G, never
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
You're all I got in this world
You're all I got in this world
Myself up out this rut and you're so much of a handful
See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
If he had, he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I think about more than I forget
Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom.
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
Possible couple of dollars you powder sniff
Cut out your livers gizzards and balls
That's nonsense!
"He's raping me," she tries to scream
Or confuse me with a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri
Maybe you need some lyric serum syrup for your symptoms
If you're gonna critique me
Tryed to take the fifth amendment use it, twist it and bend it
It was like the feelinâ€™ I had when I first started rappinâ€™
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Hell bent on revenge, you left me for dead
I'm everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
But those jeans you wore, like I've never seen before
Why you think Proof used to call me Doody?
It's like a never-ending cycle
Suck my dick, you fucking suck, bitch
Uh, it's ok, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep
Yeah, how do I look?
Evelyn, why you tryin to fight? You will never win
The rap game's God, but the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
sorry for me (me)
We kilpatrick 'n ill it,
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
It coulda been a Molotov Cocktail for that.
And if you don't like me then fuck you!
From the first time I saw you I actually said to myself, "I gotta meet her like a taxi"
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
Tip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)
"No you ain't. Come back"
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose,
"Slim Anus," you damn right, Slim Anus
Shit must have knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all
(This song's about)
The way I loved you
The way I loved you
'Cause I'd rather believe a lie
'Cause you always thought that you was
Can't believe it now you're two
Damn! How much damage can you do with a pen?
With a subliminal ball of tricks
Regardless of this I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents
Regardless of this I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Feelin' kinda breezy
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I grab what I can and do what I must
my life's so twisted
Hear you say, "Marshall, what a skank I've been!
'Cause I told you to fight.
Saved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throwaway children. We seem to be approaching an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
Mozzarella on my spaghetti put it on bread make a sandwich with Welch's
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class city
Man, I should've seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Why don't you like me?
It's bottle after bottle
Shady's back, tell a friend
Then he shall sea shells, but not by the seashore
Fry his ass, and put his ashes back together with glue,
I'm fucking going crazy
And it's absurd how people hang on every word.
And we are AmericansNow this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Just your nutsack by itself
Till I'm glad to be buried 
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! 
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy Io' fire Marshall
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
And flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake I'm 'bout
There I go--thinking of you again
everybody whose basically supported me from day one
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)
My crews true and divine, we never fronted
Looked up and I seen Swift shooting it out
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel
'Cause we consider these minutes golden
But I still remember the days of
Disgraced the race of an atheist
Who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough (huh?)
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Now that I'm down with 50
Yo.. I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it 
But when murdering females
I smile through summan' fowl, and watch my money pile,
Quite dangerous though, but my brain's in hypnosis
Sorry for that, a little minor mishap
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds
But a lot of truth is said in jest
You get on my nerves, you make me sick
The National Guard, they scared to hunt me
Just like a hood rat chick who was curious
It beez the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
There's no place you can hide, you are just an asshole
Balboa with a scalpel
So quit crying that I took your dame, homie she's my dame. Aww.
Howâ€™s that for hindsight, what the track say?
Fuck you and what you going through
-band, van full of ganja, now come on jump
But I guess that's just what sluts do
Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club like, "Oh my God, he's trippin'"
I'd probably have no reason to be.
Now what the fuck are ya doin'? You're runnin' over the snow blower
but I set precedents and the standards
it doesnt take much
(Nigga what about your wife)
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dawg in a vet
Weapon never unholstered without firin'
Lord help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening
But I'm sorry, Mama, for "Cleaning Out My Closet", at the time I was angry
You can't tell us nothing.
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear
Damn, girl, with your sexy ass, haha
I can see the light, now I'm running to it
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
you pussies think i went soft since 8 mile
I'm just kidding girl, I wouldn't lift a finger or two
Kamikaze, strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
In the back of a Contour
You weathered it and poked its eye out
Hey, looking boy, what d'you say, looking boy?
Long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es
It's ridiculous
Fresher than the harvest
Man the fuck up sissy, G's up
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
If I told y'all once, I told y'all twice, that motherfucker is nice
I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
So this must mean I'm disgusting
Drop to my knees and I'm pleading
I just opened enough eyes later on
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
I'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers
Knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
That retarded fucking face without even tasting it
I hope, the only reason that I cope,
(and go berzerk) all night long
(and go berzerk) all night long
(and go berzerk) all night long
(and go berzerk) all night long
(and go berzerk) all night long
(and go berzerk) all night long
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
Better come better than better to be a competitor
Through the radio stations one day
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
so stop at a store, pick a pint up
Just to come and shoot ya
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
I done quit chicken heads in cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'
I see you, my niggas call me the enemy watcher
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route
My nameâ€™s Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
See you in hell for the sequel (bye-bye)
Are those pistachio's damn, I'd like to have some,
You better ask somebody
If he was still alive, you would never get by
Shady, Aftermath
Shady, Aftermath
You can't help me, no one can
All of whom I'm a father to
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Innocent bystanders, I'm bound to hit some
So before I leave...
One of us shot in the back while attempting to flee
I said knock knock, let the devil in
I said knock knock, let the devil in
I love you but I just can't deal
I love you but I just can't deal
But they came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
Even this rhyme bitch, and quit tryna look
I can't quite remember when I had that
Wherever I go (yeah)
With Chris's force like you pissed him off
Screamed "Shut up!" at thunder,
Fell down and I got right back up
Pistol-whippin' motherfuckin' bouncer 6'2"
Make up a beat and cure the sucker syndrome
What I wouldn't do for you
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
Something about it, man
We're gon' have a good old time
We're gon' have a good old time
We're gon' have a good old time
We're gon' have a good old time
We're gon' have a good old time
thought I committed career suicide so I had to turn back into the bad guy
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
About anything (anything) anything (anything)
About anything (anything) anything (anything)
And I'm about to flip cause we are super glued in
I remember Malcolm,
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
Migraines, but why the fuck am I takin' these MOTRINs?
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
pain to see why everything
its a whole combination of things
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
If he's acting soft and he cowers
But we ain't fuckin' around round here
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Used to be your Romeo but we both were jilted
Words that we said that we didn't mean
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
Everybody hit the door
Everybody hit the door
Everybody hit the door
Everybody hit the door
Everybody hit the door
Want a deal? Study these 5 chapters
See you can hate him, he don't blame you frankly he would too,
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Right out the passenger side window
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold it
And put yours on the owner's table (Here listen!)
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
it's AIDS, he ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it, so you jet back home, cause you
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?

Homeboy, you better get a clue.
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter-Day Saints here
Illest shit you could think I would say
Rushin' me outside my telly, temptation overwhelms me
You had faith in me always
And still conjoined at the hip with hop
I see my target, put my car in park and approach a tender
What if he pictured it as a females butt?
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
And I'm ready to drop bombs
I'm tryna rewind time like a tape
And for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'
Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah..
Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
To hit them with the snare and the bass
Fuckin' assassins hi-jackin' Amtraks crashing
It feels like I just woke up or something
Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
You thought he was sleepin' soundly, woah
Walk her out to the parkin' lot
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Hole I'm going berserk, my nerves are bad
At anything that may stand in they way
So forcibly, don't wanna let
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
I'll give you one underdog and you gotta swing by yourself
Shady please, please dont drop the bomb on me,
Shady please, please dont drop the bomb on me,
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
This is what happens when you mix a cocunut with tabasco
That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defiant often
Makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Pathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
Baby, you're so precious
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
While player haters turn bitch like they have vaginas
I'm in the booth
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
"I don't trust you"
Unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
I'm here to save you girl
I'm here to save you girl

That's a no-no even she knows dada's fucking crazy
You 36 year old bald-headed fag blow me
"Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop Dee
Start off with the NyQuil like I think I'll just have a taste
Rap speak for me, I am the ventriloquist
So kids say no to drugs (that's right)
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
Brought it on stage, and bashed it to pieces with an aluminum bats, stanks
Either before, during or after performing the act of that which
She heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio
In fact it'll be nothin' to throw that lil' bitch with a capital B out the back window
Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen
It's shady
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shooting up while this record is spinning
And sayonara see ya fuckers tommorow,

I get to flippin' the mic' as a murder weapon
Such a wide range of emotions
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
the real, were strapped on Prozac B's and E pills, it's the rap, got the block on tip, 2 ???? of crack
You do it again I'm fucking you up,

Better hit the deck like the card dealer

Hit Jason Vorhees with 40's
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
off of it and I don't stop
You already know that I won't give up
But still I got a whole lot of patience
I can heal 'em with Neosporin
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
Could of made you anticipate
Drivin' around, I said "Let's pull over"
Let's cash that one in.
I got my grimy Shady with me you front you'll have to get me off your ass
Take the world by storm with these words I form
You hope that I choke on a Pepsi
Hateful and genius ness, inconvenience
That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her.
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake
Them lyrics you wield equals zero to a hero shield
In my shoes, just to see
In my shoes, just to see
In my shoes, just to see
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Coke is cut with tobacco
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be it's just me
With the potato peeler mushed her face into the entertainment center
Watchin' this world pass me by
That's the beauty of it yeah,
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? I would feel so much better
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? I would feel so much better
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? I would feel so much better
You wake in its wake to start the mourning process
And keep winking and blowin' kisses 'cause you're flirting with death
When I stand near it,
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
To the old H.I.
Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus
Me falling across your body
Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'm not asking to rush and answer immediately
We run it
We run it
Dr. Dre said "hell yeah!"
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker
Let me go crazy, crazy on you
I never knew I.. knew I'd..
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?
I said I'm not gonna fucking kill you
Well I'm with you homie
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write them
Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
Like a devil in disguise,
Pee in a teacup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleeping
If you knew him earlier in his days its like a different version
If you knew him earlier in his days its like a different version
And the way I flip my tongue on the track
Why do you think they call it a snatch
And pull that pen and pad up outta your purse
So everybody come and get up on the floor
With the rhyme Iâ€™m spittin' while Iâ€™m shittin' on competition
But stop just ain't in her vocabular.
And we really love it when you think we're guilty 'cause we're black
Pissed off, 'cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
But it was X, and they called it "Pubic Hair on Chelsea"
I'd give anything to rewind it
While you are being done in
Adult with a childish-like arrogance
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
Just thinking ahead, Iâ€™ma make it if it kills me
For shoes, fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition Troops
But it's over now
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
Point him out man I wanna know
Point him out man I wanna know
Point him out man I wanna know
Lady you can suck a dick til your neck aches
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
No one seems to know my struggle
No one seems to know my struggle
No one seems to know my struggle
No one seems to know my struggle
Gimme the keys I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
Dang knives'll butcher them gay wives
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
Here we go again
Oh! Jackpot! Yeah, 'Open Sesame' mouth

Nope, Paul Wall is dope
("Em") Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde
What goes through an addict's brain?
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Willin' to stick out my neck
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
That will do whatever the fuck
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Somebody, please help him!
And Brad if you try to stand between us then we're gonna see bro
And while I'm being poetic let me get historic and raise the bar
Can't you see what you do to me baby?
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all
Because you stay with me, maybe, because you're as crazy as I am
I hate your fuckin' guts, you fuckin' slut, I hope you die
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears

But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
Ain't no conversation
She said "No, I'm bi"
Not even a wink, I don't blink
You've always kept out of mine.
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scale or being gay little faggot
Never sold dope, from the gold rope
Before you beat the shit out me.
I play your music while you suffer like I'm Carmine Coppola
It's like the greatest gift you can get

Smoked out like Eckridge
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop K.Dot to Shady
Fuck fuck fuck can't take the stress

Stop sleepin on my roof bitch
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album
'Cause the wait is over
So how much easier would life be
What is a brighter ass if she wants a computer lodged in her vagina?
Or forget I was ever this incredible
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end.
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there
Plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Started a group of misfits
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin told you!
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
With a strap that wraps twice around my back then they latch it
Am I bizerk or insane
Big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say
From the fact that Iâ€™m cominâ€™ back
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol and go through no withdrawal
Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
Went through 'em and laughed
Push the whip, see me rolling, you can tell that I'm holding
80 degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
I tantalize ya in less than five seconds I get ya
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
Shit's sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
(Oh, thank you)
Crunk, crunk, crunk
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
I just show up go up to the stage and blow up the spot,
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick
A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it
To the kids who played him
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for comin' out, peace!
I was going to say something extremely important
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
With the thorn bush that you
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
They were the ones who were left in charge
And it's sad but it's true,
I cannot reason with you
If you got dissed at the shop 'cause if they caught you slippin'
I just wanna be normal
Hit the wheels on that Phantom, man, that shit looks like the Batmobile
up since the A Slim Shady gave me the gate key, paid the ways
But you just won't listen will ya, nah I guess not
But you just won't listen will ya, nah I guess not
But you just won't listen will ya, nah I guess not
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
I gotta question if I may? (Yeah)
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
B.o.B I done told you once homie to easy up, geez
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round.
Ha ha haOw ow ow
Thought we was running shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
I fuckin' take a Make a Wish Foundation patient with me
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
Checking for your record when it's selling
To fuck you up quicker
Wanna lose you, keep you, bruise you
I'd rather see the president dead
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre,
Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lotta shit but I'm backing it all up
In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
Oops my CD just skipped
You half of a half-way crook; get off X dick, go sing a hook!
Then screamed "ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?"
I don't know, I don't know but I'll probably be this way 'til my dying day
Eyes dilated
 Who wanna play dungeon? 
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Only nigga that I trust, is me
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
Nickle-plated, twenty two, two, two
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
When you say these mean things
When you say these mean things
When you say these mean things
When you say these mean things
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
Even if it sounds corny,
Pile the carnage up 'til its so high, it's touching the sky
Been with you guys thick and thin
Fork was in the road took the psycho path
it means the greatest of all time
it means the greatest of all time
it means the greatest of all time
Self-made goals (Hey)
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil' Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e, Polow Tha Don, Dre
Shit's on, bruh
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me
Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me
Produce hits to break
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
I confess I'm a static addict I guess
When there's no one to hit
When this life makes you're mad enough to kill
Not again!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to hurt you!
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Haven't I seen you before?", looked at my nigga
As I go and try to close for the night's show
plane
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat
I'm sure to have something for your rear
And just go and be me
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on that
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada
But fuck the PepÃ© Le Pew shit!
(I'll stick around)
A million dollars ain't even that far away man
How much that cost? That's what I call the cost to splurge
please, be that just subliminally
War machine? But you've forced me in a corner
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
Yay me, I did it! Did what?
This beautiful pill dust in my palm
Million voices in my head, but still get a little bit of thrill
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
How you guys, accepted me for me and Pace
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
Calling all party animals, get
50 cent, come on!
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring
I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
From the home of potholes and trash
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
Scatter-brained
But sometimes the shit just seems
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
My filet is smoking weed,
I'll bring you through the ghetto without riding round
Let's all get on down
Let's all get on down
Let's all get on down
Let's all get on down
Let's all get on down
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Word to Method Man
I think my rubber's coming off
Get executed, cuz I'm a "Luni"
For every motherfuckin' thing you ever put us through
Can you hear me?
Then I breathe a sigh of relief, I don't believe in
Me and Eminem and Mike
Lose yourself in this music
Lose yourself in this music
Lose yourself in this music
Lose yourself in this music
You can call me an asshole I'm glad
I tried to get over you
The moon is full. I smell a funeral. Guess I'll loom in the park.
'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me.
you will see that I'm
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums
Don't hurt me.
One puff of the chron
I better stop and say my grace
I better stop and say my grace
I better stop and say my grace
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics, Andre, you're fucking right!
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass, then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
Came out with a white flag hollerin' "TRUCE TRUCE!"
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga
Slim, "chauvinist pig drove in this big, Lincoln town car!"
A bunch of sweets or something, what?
You don't want me, I just want you more,
Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on me
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
We was being laughed at "You ain't even half black."
There's a storm comin' that the weather man couldn't predict,
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
This is only the beginning
And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
Who knows what the future for us could hold.
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Must've just heard the sound of my stomach
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
Better get your girlfriend in check. It's psychological warfare. Endorphins I affect.
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Don't fall on my face
This is what I eat, sleep, breath an feed my kids whatever I feel my family needs
Just a problem in wallowing fumes
It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
Immortality like I have got
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
Shady man, no, don't massacre the fans
Same reason I wrestle with mania
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty's shaking like Jello
And I'm like a spider crawlin' up your spinal column
Blue lights flashing, laughing all the way to the bank
Two little beautiful girls
My love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
And walk around the party without a care
To get your brain relaxing, the zany-acting maniac in action
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit
I'm on the toilet bowl
Police saying "freeze"
Police saying "freeze"
Police saying "freeze"
It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding,
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
When you're so good that you can't say it
Add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
From all of angles of us, flash a Mack loud enough
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
he's so gone off that coke, right
You never step out of line
"Ain't steppin' to you, bitch," I say to myself
Like damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow,
No, I won't sign your autograph
and it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping "Shady what the fuck you saying!?"
the fuck im spose to do now?
Talking that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Watch the wood grain,
Marshall! Sounds like an SOS
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's, baby,
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
I'm revved up; who said what? When lead bust
wanted to bone her, she foamin' at the lips, the one between them hips, pubic hairs lookin' like
Doin the cha-cha and the cucaracha with a quadra-
'Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
Dr. Dre. wants to square dance with me
Got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns
To do black music so selfishly
'Cause it's your goddamn jam
You put E before the D, 'cause that's all you on
And discovered this DJ who was mixing
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his ninth beer
So this shit just always feels so weird
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
One last time for Charlamagne
It's all political, if my music is literal, and I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Keep 'em up
So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 
Climb up to the window, look at her.
Way I'm kickin' these fairies tails
(I can almost taste it.)
(But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't)
Somebody turn the 'Vacancy' sign on 'cause I'm gone blowin' up my
And ain't shit you can do but fear it
Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, leftThe days are cold living without you (without you)
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Where all vunerable and it's spooky
To right where I was and perhaps
'Cause I'm steaming mad (Grr)
I know the mark's high, butterflies rip apart my stomach
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
To more shows, haunted you nights I suppose
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
You're the same as me
Friends are people that you think are your friends
Last album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus
Some of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches
We can't self destruct
Immature, Me? Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang
On how
This coulda been my victory lap if I wasn't on the verge of Relapse
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people
Domestic disputes but we've always
Another shooter. Uh oh.
We can smoke till there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
Gas, the match and igniter.
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me,
That's understandable, man, but think how bananas you'd be.
So if I hurt your self-esteem
I'm freestylin every verse that I spit
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
Wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
Summer's Eve Massengill
Rush to emergency surgery
I said one more time for old time's sake Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
I'm mur-durin the flow, liquid courage I'm fin' to blow
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
And it's destroying him slowly
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
I'm feeling hard as hell right now homie
I could stay in bed with ya starin' at ya 'til the morn'
I said get out, bitch!
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman
To a diabolical gynecologist, tryna ball a fist I will
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
So why, w-w-why else, would I call myself an alien?
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too
See? Aint no reason to sick the dogs on me,
See? Aint no reason to sick the dogs on me,
Cause he won't even let them try to breathe, Dadidadidadadi
his knees?
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
Can't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on (oh..)
Let's break-dance if you think you're hardcore
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I crawled out my grave, you better be ready and set
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
My bitch, know I'm perfectly fit, for murder
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
When that Kamikaze hit (When that Kamikaze hit)
Donald Duck's on, there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
It's too late to save our love
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Relapsing under that
But if there's one fraction of truth
Drop the bomb on em,
Drop the bomb on em,
But, shit, I'm stingy as fuck
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!
Live to regret it and you die trying to violate it
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
With every second each closer to death
Oh, they can all get fucked.
Oh, they can all get fucked.
'Til we saw how wrong we were
So the FCC won't let me be
but I doubt
I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
My bad, sorry!
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
Thought I could endure the pressure
To rest your soul, you could leave the rest to me
So you don't use it to your advantage.
'Least I made it out of that house and found a place in this world when the day was done
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
I represent everything you take for granted
Mama, I'mma grow one day to be famous and I'mma be a pain in the anus
Mama, I'mma grow one day to be famous and I'mma be a pain in the anus
Mama, I'mma grow one day to be famous and I'mma be a pain in the anus
That's like an inside of an engine
All the happy people who have real nice lives
Rather have me (I know, but), we just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)Oh oh oh oh oh ooh
I don't know, it's just the way I amI'm a goat
Nother one after Recovery was so highly coveted
He ain't have a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are!"
ya playin motherfuckin checkers
Yo, take us on outta here
What size you wear? I wear tens
People when you're rappin' and you know what for
Can't pump my gas without causin' an accident
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
I don't give a fuck I don't play!
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?
Im twice as dread and evil and rancid
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
But by the way, thoughts are getting darker by the day
Dr. Dre? (What up?)
Teenagers act more fuckin' mature Jack
To count the shit up and then bust the shit down
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
Must've fell in love with skeletons
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I got no time for no games Nah uh, he ain't playin'
Still on the loose, they
And as we proceed,
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
Does this look like a big joke?
While he played piano
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
Man I think she had enough of those pills
Knowin' there is nothin' you can do about it
Well, shit, if you believe that then I'll kill you.
Mama always said...
About hip-hop is we so close
Our family's mixed up,
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest. So...
You just make me get so crazy.
The way she's grindin' that pole
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two liter wein
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
He wants to keep up his tough demeanour
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group
In your living room, ha-ha
To make sure I keep up with my competition
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
I'll be one tough act to follow
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
Whose eyes get so squinted
Please release me from these demons
I might leave in the bodybag, but never in cuffs
Screaming "Fuck the World" like Tupac
This has not to do with muscular
And my lips and the clips got the cig lit like it's nicotine
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
What? Comes on Quilted Northern
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
I'm on the patron
We should be together, too
The time has come to tie her up.
'Cause my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
The thought of no more me and you
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If Proof could see me now I know he'd be proud
Continue to peep, still bent low
I'm reaching for the Glock, but the music stops
DA got that dope
Get away from me, I don't know you
But juicier ass, it belongs in a juicer
You got shot in your video trying mock Pac
It's silly ho why must we try,
But they love it when you make your business public
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
look there's got to be something better, you know what I'm saying?
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
I'm out the game, put the second string in
Been here longer than anyone in the game
Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop
Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold.
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold.
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold.
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold.
While extending this shit
That bimbo Kim put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow
Fuck!
(huh)
To calm her, wow
Can I hold grudges, mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this."
I took a hiatus haters now Iâ€™m back to cause trouble
Wake up like a pack of wolves and we came here to extract the roof
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like ya that's great
Whatever I didn't drink on my bladder pack it up and take the rest with me
Been tryin' to hunt me down like a dog 'cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
That'll stab you with a sharp object
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
'Til I walk a flock of flames
With them benzodiazepines gone
To a mental hospital with Britney
All the pain inside amplified by the
That you hear on your radio
That you hear on your radio
That you hear on your radio
Guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Elevate to new height
Cause I have no room for improvement
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
That's what he says to himself
I'm gonna cum, I am
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
Haha, sorry Mom
You must be gone off that water bottle
Bitch, I beat up my friends
Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
'Cause they hurt you so bad
Like the hot potato game, thats why we came to
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
Your health is declining with your self-esteem, you're crying out for help
You better lose yourself in the music
You better lose yourself in the music
You better lose yourself in the music
You better lose yourself in the music
You better lose yourself in the music
You better lose yourself in the music
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?
And can't find answers
I built this castle
I built this castle
I built this castle
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero
Hailie, tell 'em baby
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
Money is the root of all evil
Pow-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
'til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
When you step away son, she got her face done
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
I need to go puke! (Bleahh!)
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
Out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
Psych, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Yo, his verses were crazy on that Renegade beat
If I'd have made it to the hospital
In our business your friends like to pry so
We are Samaritans
We are Samaritans
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways.
So on a bigger stage
A big Chinese nigga, screamin "Kuniva yo yo.."
It's actually disastrously bad
Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
So you better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
Letâ€™s see how far I can take it with this music
Grab a couple grand and live a nice land
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have,
But so I gotta catch her first
But I just wanna see ya
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
I have died clinically
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?
But this earth calling Shady, man come on back (what?)
Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Alright, stop! (Huh?)
Death itself, it can't hurt me
See I've never been so sure, and your just insecure
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh!
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh!
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
The sky is blue, the tires are new
And I hate to be the bad guy
And I hate to be the bad guy
I'll do the opposite (I'll do the opposite)
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
Cause you know I'll win it, name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And it's your birthday
I don't need your help
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
Like I'm always under attack, man, I coulda stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
And get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
You unleashed on a team
I am not afraid to die
It's not what you expected, not what you thought, so
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim's
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adios
Had 'em just appalled did so many things that pissed 'em off
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
You're taking this shit too far
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
You say it's gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down
Reminiscin' all listening to 50 fifty times a day
Just to make sure God hears cause this ice layer
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro
Like sedatives you'll get popped, Excedrin
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
But what the heck's all of these buttons?
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us."
I get lost in this game, game, game
I get lost in this game, game, game
I get lost in this game, game, game
I get lost in this game, game, game
That's my sector
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see
Blow every fucking thing, except Afghanistan on the map, off
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
I got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em (I'm done)
I used to love your company now you always bugging me 
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
Shady's got the mass appeal
It is what it is dogg, man life's not fair
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
Self made, I've never needed your bail or a wire, see
Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh!
Raise 'em high in the sky,
I'd hang it up but the frame is all cracked
We elevated to new heights premeditated 
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Then something told me relax and just hope for the show to be packed
While I do it pizzicato
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Soon as I grab, squeeze
Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
How, why now! What up Dre?
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
But the beat goes on: da da dum da dum da da da da
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
In the same exact pattern
As time passes
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie
'Cause they fucking go bananas
We both have,
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
If you had them choked up you'd be yankin' my chain
'Cause I watch TV, and Comcast cable
I bet you I bet he probably just wants to see how upset you would get I'll go handle this of course, unless you object"
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
But it's happening again, huh?
Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
That'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
I'm feelin' like the greatest (woo!)
Everybody (everybody)
Everybody (everybody)
Everybody (everybody)
Everybody (everybody)
To wait by the door and pack his bags
I swear to god, I hate you
Never met someone who played games with my head as much
I go to make a fist
I woke up next to you naked and uh, did we umm?
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent
"Look, there's an apple!" "No it's not, it's a peach!"
I said who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
I don't give a damn what you think
In school this shit helps for sure, I'm gettin' more self-assured than I've ever been before
Here I lay
Don't you remember me?!
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
And this song's for all ya
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it's a Porsche
Knowing your Smith & Wesson has never been clutched?
And it's cool if you let one go
Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more
You barely feel those anymore
Ricky-Ticky-Toc-Ticky-Ticky-Toc
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne
We may never understand each other, it's no use
Fuck you hip-hop
There was a little rapper about to blow
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
I'd like to introduce myself
Ball like J, but not Jay as in
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity, I'm a
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my mom
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
You wanted Shady? You got him!
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Feelings I harbor, all this pent-up resentment I hold on to
Am I too loud for you?
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Grazed one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall
Shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
'cause one thing I never asked was
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
On a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin' snapped the rudder in half
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
And I'm tryna run and get my motherfucking gun
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
You remember that night you prayed to God
And I ain't got to lie about my age
Shady why you gotta pick on the lady for,
Was you and me, once used to be together forever
I'm already on my knees
Let 'em all line up and attack
A king-size bed, but I sleep on the couch
I second that and I third,
Yeah, I live on the edge, I sit on the ledge
{Screamin' out no regrets, yeah, no regrets though, no white flags either}
Oh, what's the matter Kim?
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
Gotti with the stainless
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
Releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range
Gosh I wish I could've told you to not do the same
That's the sound of the Glock
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
That windshield's too strong for you
That windshield's too strong for you
That windshield's too strong for you
He's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek.
This won't hurt a damn bit, 
But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)
But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)
But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)
But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)
But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)
But I guess I must've killed 'em (killed 'em)
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
I'm like O.J. he's like my Cochran today
So let's Bang!! all up in my head
Is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin 
And they connected with me too because I looked like them,
All the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,
Wait! What if there's an explanation for this shit?
You set it off faggot so now how do you 'spose
Get it dick-snots?
But I'm just plain stubborn, I'm Audi five thou'
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
Yeah... yo, yo
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
Let off then I'm reloading
I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
I'm goin' to get the needle and thread from the sowin' kit
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
And Fifâ€™ here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit
With so much leg-room and air space on this airplane
And by tomorrow
Whisked away in an ambulance is your fate
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Guess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
Every place and event.. (been there, done that)
off her back, jab her if she act
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
already got a steady infrared meant for my head
And my nuts, licked, gobble 'em up trick, yummy
Hate fags? The answer's "yes"
while I blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like
Get it? Headed off to (haha)
Shoulda never made a response, shoulda just aimed for the fake ones
Shit, we never knew was possible
Music has changed my life in so many ways
When will I stop? I don't know
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
Two to the one from the one to the three
No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
And it's my fault I got this way
She used to tell me he hated me
So here I am and I will not run
So here I am and I will not run
I, I hate
I have learned, from fighting fights, that weren't mine
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content -
Addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
'Cause you're fake, ah what the fuck, that hurt wait!
So stop dwelling and I am not failing
The F.B.I might be tryin to pull my file soon
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch
("I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes")
Boom boom chuck, b-boom, Shady!
Say hi Bob! ("Hi Bob") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
That she's really, she's really coming back
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I ain't shoulder leaning, I ain't snapping and popping
Hurry the fuck up! Thank you!
They say Iâ€™m nasty, say Iâ€™m crazy
They say Iâ€™m nasty, say Iâ€™m crazy
Slaughterhouse on fire, nobody touching that
And plus I can bust in that,
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
I looked at my watch it was one twenty
When its time its your time
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Holy mackerel. I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth. I smacked a girl
Put two milk crates in the trunk
'Cause you missed a lot and never caught it
There's no guarantee,
There's no guarantee,
Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
Haters stay on these nuts
Cupid could shoot another one of them God damn darts at me
Well when you look at my pee
'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not gonna stop
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
This is Destiny, yes money I'm off running
You don't know me
I aint nuttin' nice, man I like to pull knives and I like to cut
It's just his ghetto point of view
Sneak up with a lethal injection
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
it's just me
it's just me
it's just me
it's just me
it's just me
it's just me
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
Eminem offend? No! Eminem'll insult
Yo', I woke up fucked up off the liquor I drunk, I had a bag of the skunk won in last nights
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things
But why is she so wicked?
Or I'mma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Or I'mma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fucking idiots still (still)
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
I'm takin' two-by-fours to our eight-by-tens
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
But up until the instant that I went against it
On a shucka corn
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house
Half you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
to get me to this point
Rest in peace to Big Proof, you was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
I'm swimming in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial
You said you're moving on
Sit up front
'Cause drugs really got a hold of me
Its like I got ya hypnotising like I gotcha
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed,
I hope you hear it we're in a car right now
Well that's a bunch of crap
Once I get on two, hits of X
So lonely and cold,
So lonely and cold,
I could accomplish any task
This prick is bigger than I am
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
Still grindin', still shinin', nigga lord knows,
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling,
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling,
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling,
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling,
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling,
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling,
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling,
After you, I swore to make the gray skies end
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
All this time, me and Dre been fucking with hats off
Fack fack fack
Fack fack fack
Fack fack fack
Fack fack fack
I'm looking for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I'm looking for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Of you on the table
See how far that line goes
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
I'm as cold as a muthafucking icicle on my nut
My insecurities could eat me alive
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?)
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
Until paranoia caused me
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But i'm not about to give up, I gotta get up
Until the other begs,
And hoodie black, should be strapped to a chair or stretcher
Nobody better test me, cuz I don't wanna get messy
I literally keep three shottas
Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, mothafucker!
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
and Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write
On the beach of Saint-Tropez, but your man donâ€™t lay
And make them do shit illegal
Hit the corner liquor store
we playin chess you playin checkers
Full breast, ready to touch
Cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them,
How did you figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
But this shit is new gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
Rap will never be the same as before
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And all the medicine you fed us
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
And everyone just heard you let one rip
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be
It was like winning a used mink
Hey man
I run shit like an ass with legs
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Cap'n Crunch
You better at least be as good or better
I'm lyrically James Todd, Tariq Trotter minus the cap
If you duck him up Donald Fagen
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
Small girls
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
But if Irv really gave a fuck
They say I cause extensive
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
which is still, to this day
You high, baby?
Iâ€™ll stand there and yell that at a wall
Pull the lever then, trapdoor, death is evident
Your hobby isn't robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid
its too late chump now face up
I'm at a crossroads, lost, still shopping at Costco's
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself,
'Cause the next day we're right back at it
Til I'm snapping my spine,
I just don't know,
I just don't know,
I just don't know,
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Ya girl's a freak, man sometime we share
Turned forty and still sag
Fuck it, I am crazy
All over our necks like we're showing 'em off not knowing at all
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
There's no method the pad and pen
Talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
When I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor
I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
And get up and get my own
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
Because I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
And I am, whatever you say I am
And I am, whatever you say I am
That's how fuckin' rowdy you feel, now you still wanna grill?
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (skrrt!)
(Shady!)
I can't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So homie lay down down down, lay down down down, lay down down down, lay down lay down.
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you..
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy
In in in
group backed him up
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper
From it I pray that I don't fall
From it I pray that I don't fall
From it I pray that I don't fall
With McDonald's jump on her lap and watch the Sopranos..
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
I'm bout to relapse so baby pour me some Jack Daniel's
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain
Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
Slim Shady!
"Well I got him on the phone right now!"
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fucking acronym
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
In the mansion
Erra Erra Eric swallowed some generic sleeping pills
Through a tube
Through a tube
Through a tube
Through a tube
Knowledge is power, but powerless
So bad
So bad
So bad
So bad
When it's hot, it's hot
I'll be the S-L to the I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
Look at my daughter's face... "Mommy, something is wrong with dad, I think.
it was real, we just
White America, I could be one of your kids,
White America, I could be one of your kids,
White America, I could be one of your kids,
White America, I could be one of your kids,
White America, I could be one of your kids,
White America, I could be one of your kids,
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (what?)
Jarred like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly
If I get sniped tonight you know why,
A teddy like short for Theodore
You already know
Emotional wrecks
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Looked at as a failure (yeah)
Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Crazy on you
I never knew I..
I never knew I..
I never knew I..
I never knew I..
I never knew I..
I never knew I..
I never knew I..
I never knew I..
We stranglin rappers until the point they can't yell
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why
Or by the phone for Mom to call
It's even tougher when sleeping
Everybody just wants to have something to do with that
Another day in the life (uh)
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move till I'm provoked
Severing flesh of fools who never impressed I can confess
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,
Tirelessly on the phone tryna rustle up muscle relaxers
Send the fellow Shady dane came to wrap the game up in cellophane,
Lesson two: Face em and diss em (Whattup dog?)
Turn him into plastic so for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
(I'm back)
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
That's what it sounds like in my brain
And have another episode where I let it go as far as
Yeah I don't think this guy is well.. I'm high as hell
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
There ain't nobody as bomb as me
It's politics, it's all a fix
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
I make rappers wanna turn into singers
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
You get the bandages Now baby just bend over
But I just can't sit back and wallow
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon come is Tupac
D-12.. Dirty motherfuckin Dozen
Mama always said, "Son, if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, guess it pays to be brainless."
Mama always said, "Son, if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, guess it pays to be brainless."
Mama always said, "Son, if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, guess it pays to be brainless."
Actin' like you catchin' bodies (ayy!)
And run around screaming, "I don't care, just bite me" (nah nah)
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
This dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute
It's survival of what?
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
So take it all
So take it all
So take it all
When I blew; see, but it was confusing
I'm nice ya'll, fuck it, I'm out cold
Now my mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
I'm sick as hell boy,
All I know is that (What?)
Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy
Do not come and speak to me (speak to me)...
"We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
I can't imagine what's goin' through you mind
I'm the longest needle around here
But this time, when I get pulled over
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous 
Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way
They tell us, "No," we say, "Yeah," they tell us, "Stop," we say, "Go."
Never looking back and we're never getting old
Never looking back and we're never getting old
Never looking back and we're never getting old
Never looking back and we're never getting old
Like the girl on Set It Off did
Other mic go, stab you til' the knife goes - dull
'Cause that's where most of my anger is based
The white trash star
Put it on my dick 'til the tip looks orange.
Takin' forever to change, it's stuck these bitches are lovin' it
But the smartest shit I did was take them bullets outta that gun
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Looking like a dog that's pissing
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I just don't give a fuck!
I just don't give a fuck!
I just don't give a fuck!
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Shady, we're back
Shady, we're back
Shady, we're back
Shady, we're back
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
Faced with a dilemma: I can be Dalai Lama
I enter Central Park, it's dark, it's winter in December
Ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes
He'll fucking flip on ya
He'll fucking flip on ya
He'll fucking flip on ya
He'll fucking flip on ya
He'll fucking flip on ya
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that - why am I so misunderstood?
Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandealous
To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
See children, drugs are bahhhd (uh-huh)
This is where the fun stops
This is where the fun stops
This is where the fun stops
This is where the fun stops
This is where the fun stops
No I don't!
And telling every girl she the one for me
And telling every girl she the one for me
And telling every girl she the one for me
And telling every girl she the one for me
And telling every girl she the one for me
How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours
Walk in the arraignment, shoot the bailiff
And walkin through south central l.a., bleedin in jeans
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
The size of a sword, boy, I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
each other cause none of us had deals
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
In my moments of weakness
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists"
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody that I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it.
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
Giving haters incubators, think ya made a mistake,
So I'm click-clackin' this toy, mash and destroy
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
'Cause somebody paired us up
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
Getting head, guillotine
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
My pops left me and often my momma wasn't home
Ooh, no more tripping in bird shit, songs of self-empowerment surging
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
But if I can't batter the women
You guys are always mean to me anyways 
Her with the bat.
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
If ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then I can
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?
But I can hear you, my love. You keep calling me.
But I can hear you, my love. You keep calling me.
Big fame, big chains
It's like something takes over me,
It's like something takes over me,
It's like something takes over me,
With an ass to match, girl your body is lit
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
I'm alive again
Flies up, under thighs, ugh, like a gyser, uh
with the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
The way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
Has taken four years just to put out an album beat
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
Can't tell if I'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
No more pain bitch you
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
I smell something in the air that's making me high
We were globally huge, watching sales go through the roof
Has aspirated
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me.
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me.
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me.
'Cause every time I write a rhyme,
'Cause every time I write a rhyme,
Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row
She said "Help me I think I'm having a seizure!"
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
It was funny back in our youth
But Iâ€˜ll go to bat for you, defending your honor
Girl you know it's true
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad
Knows that she can but she won't say no
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
Doctors had to put it down
I'm bipolar with the switch up just as quick like you cumming
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan
Doing, doing, doing
Doing, doing, doing
Doing, doing, doing
Doing, doing, doing
Doing, doing, doing
Doing, doing, doing
Doing, doing, doing
Doing, doing, doing
Doing, doing, doing
Doing, doing, doing
I'mma shit stain on the underwear of life
"Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?
Know what I'm sayin'?
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as a Caesarean
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! 
Just a feeling I've got
I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on
It controls my pen (my evil twin),
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
Gotta vent, lot of innocent lives lost on the project bench
You're a cock boy, everybody wants you
No more drama from now on, I wanna promise
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
And I ain't even gotta make no god damn sense
Then I set the truth on fire
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
When inside I'm dying.
Look at me now; I bet you're probably sick of me now ain't you mama?
Boy girl dog woman man child
You're screaming, "Fuck the world!" with your middle finger up
'Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
You're too old
ay yo 50
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass
Ah what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening
Happily married, to rap and I'm glad that we buried
Guess show time is over no suicide note
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
Fuck that, I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle a mall
K-Fed, iHop
K-Fed, iHop
Im a problem for ya, boy you think your Tom Sawyer,
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?
If it could be spun back I would do
Yo what is the what?
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns
And it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
I'll punch your daddy not, your mom's kinda cock
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
Khaki's pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced, so I guess it ain't
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
And dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
It begins to seep in
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
You niggasâ€”
Used to always have my back
Used to always have my back
"What do I do?"
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
And I'm the suit, so call meâ€”
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em
Ain't nobody iller than me
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen's really dust smoking?
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
My pubes hotter than you
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
From Bel-Air shopping center just for stopping in there
The honest gesture
And constantly be reminded
Bitch you was supposed to correct me
But that gal has some knockers
Thanks it's been real
Malevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
But sometimes when you combine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (prr!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
We ain't eager to be legal
Don't kill nobody this time
I don't want no doggone beef,
Because
Boy dont jinx yourself,
So it's him instead of me, but I'll be your second string, now and forever because
Here I go again
I'm just a regular guy,
I'm just a regular guy,
I'm just a regular guy,
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Yeah ask Denaun, man
And you're scared to effin' death of it
What you say, what you do,
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3
Got the fucking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles
We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
I got a Magic Johnson
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair
I cock it back then shoot it
Flying off at the handle at my mom, no dad
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
I put an end to your life (sex crime)
All kinds of really mean things
All kinds of really mean things
All kinds of really mean things
All kinds of really mean things
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
I'm blacking out, you better watch it (It's bedlam)
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth
In the middle of the aisle whilin'
All I got to do is point to the spot,
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
That tells us that any doubts in your head that seals the shit
We ain't bluffin for nothin, we'll knock the stuffin out you
Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
If what you vision is tours, or a mission less course
When they were just musketeers in the Mickey Mouse club
For each other grow stronger
Financial interest is the matter at hand
No!
With a scythe
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Maybe it says somethin' about me
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
I'm livin' to conquer, remember the mantra, I'm grippin' the launcher
I asked myself, do I love these hoes? No!
Stuck on the fence on a balance beam if I seem unbalanced
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
And I'mma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes
some sour cream dip, without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though, pussy tighter than
To take it to the next level, boost it
that I do all types of.. retarded shit

I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a c*** in mouth and get my balls blew out
Bumpin and grindin that pole
I know some shits so hard to swallow
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
and don't come back until something dope hits you
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
He's so stacked that he knows
Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's organic
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
We gotta take these cards ourselves
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you (ah-ha ha)
Motherfucker I'm grown
You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
Look at your husband now! (No!)
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, i say it proudly
'Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
Snoop said this in 94' "We don't love them hoes"
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful Yeah
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
tank top screaming lotto i dont fit you
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be I'm sorry momma
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe I know you want me baby
I did not even get to see Mary Kate's shower scene
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
Fuck you tipper Gore
You never wanted someone so bad ya sweating
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad!
and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
Shady sits on the shelf
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
And imagine him giving him an adjective an a** whooping
Talk to me
I can't call it
And I show no shame from coast to coast
Can you dig what I'm sayin' man, can you smell me?
my motto fuck lotto
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
For any nigga wid Hammer
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
And she begun to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet
quick someone get his ass another steroid
Psych! I joke, I joke! I keed, I keed!
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
I sit on top of you squeezin' til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But I don't need it.
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
he had a father and his mother wasnt crazy as shit
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
and he never dreamed he could rip stadiums
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
Red pills, blue pills and green
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Till I see dumb shit start happenin' Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms
Look at him haulin' ass I think he left his wife
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch and say fagot
Oh I'm so fucking hot, and you're so fucking hot,
4 pac 3 pac 2 pac 1
And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
Fuck what these cynics say
"Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem"
Come on kemosabe
You lil' brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
If she current I keep her pussy purring like the pipes on a lamp
yellow nigga, no cabs
Been there, done that, aw fuck it
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember
When I caught a guy
And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
Drop the biscuit (I will!)
Knowin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
People don't usually come back this way
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you like likes on the Gram
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze And you only live it once
There's nothing spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
We're the ones who made you So baby, baby, get down, down, down Baby, get down, down down
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady!
I'm an easy rider dreamin' of Wynonna I roam the country like a Greyhound bus
Tell a friend Now everyone report to the dance floor
I'm ready to make everyone's throat ache
Like I don't think anyone's real,
Maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show we love 'em back
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said
Hate Versace, Versace, I got MÃ¼nchhausen by proxy
If you move again I'll beat the shit out of you (Okay)
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
Mind's like a pile of clay
Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
It's so appeasin' Now I'm gonna make you dance
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
S-superstar, girl, I'm ready for you mama!
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Until I met Dre
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
And bust open like broken water mains
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
Cause these others low key with the snaking faking
lets pretend, marshall mathers never picked up a pen
You got somethin' to say?!
get it back, give it back ain't 'bout shit
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
Brady's returning, matter fact I may be deserving
And it wasn't time to move in school no changing again
And get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
Go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
More alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You think I give a fuck!
In fact grab a six pack
First off you don't know Marshall
Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
You know the aim is to bang you
"I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock"
Just sprays and sprays
yeah they call me rabbit this is the turtle race
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
Mr. Officer! I'm already on my knees
Everything is so tense and gloom
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
I'm not guilty
A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
And she's on top, I'm gonna fackin', oh god,
Same shit, different toilet, oh you got a nice ass darlin'!
'Cause I got this motherfucking cloud over my head
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
You outta work, I know it's tough
(You're drunk! you're never going to get away at this!)
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
I don't know but I can tell you what they drove
Now you wanna run around talking bout guns like I ain't got none
But before I tie a rope around this nob
People shot all over the floor
After it bothered ya fathers
I am me, I'm a fire marshall and this is my Legacy, legacy, here
And why I just don't know Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do cause I'm about to lose my mind
It's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me You don't be fuckin' with the blue eye
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even hear it he pretends that Airplanes
Mary P., Slim Shady
You don't think so do you
Been shinin' like a diamond but gettin' passed as coal So fuck off
Like he got carrots up his ass-crack
How the fuck could you do this to me?
There ain't nobody as bomb as me
Fack, I just came again, okay pull it out now,
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
'Cause someone told me that
talkin about shit's creek
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
'Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
People will still camp out from the night before
Faggot, you think I'm scared of you? You gonna ruin my career, you better get one
I'm a take control of this relationship
See the twenty's spinning looking mean on the six
Even when you bitches are counting me out, and I appear to be down for the count
I'm out of control like no
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
pay attention, you're sayin the same shit that he said
To Michael Jackson activator
Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
Thank god I'm alive I gotta find Denaun
We won't quit until we're banned from existence Persistence pays if that holds true
I'm cleaning out my closet Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
So fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
How many times you fly to my house? Still trying to count
My teacher didn't think I was going to be nothing either
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
And they need to take it up with me after the show
This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
If I hear another word so don't go opening your jibs
And broke his nose, this house is a broken home
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
Its true that I had a few
This guy's a gangster, his real name's Clarence And Clarence lives at home with both parents
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
'Cause I'm only giving you, things you joke about with your friends
Your tasin' them with like pages in
Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
How could you?
Used forgetfully so I cut class and ditch it now I fully rap Cadillac from a K Car, my a** from a hole in the ground, still can't tell em apart
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right
Even if it sounds corny,
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
"I dont like this, no!"
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
Fuck shots! I hope the weed will outweigh these drinks
Here, want a snack?
Jessica Simpson looks oh so tempting
Pretend he just made excuses that
Ow that hurts! take it out now
And I ain't leaving this party tonight
(Homie, they spent) Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve
You ran me into the ground, but what comes around goes around (Yeah)
Now I'm talking a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it
So everyday I have at least three stomach aches
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs
I must have got my pimping genes from him, the way he left my mama
But all you savage cats
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
bitch you can be up piss creek with paddles this deep
I can't even write a rhyme without doin' it
You don't get another chance,
Oh my, Em
But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle
I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
Nobody is safe from me! No, not even me
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm poppin' niggas tonight
And get up and get my own, I was never the type of kid
It's past time, like your favorite hobby
File you a lawsuit, I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) (Dreamin', of fallin, dreamin', of fallin') Let's pretend like its '98
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin' As time passes, things change everyday
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
The same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells "Bitch!"
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want
You at a stand, still, mannequin
But your husband's heart problem is complicating
And wear it like a badge with honour, pass it around and share it
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby!
And forever we can drag this on and on
We'll be right back
So I guess it ain't
By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up
This G-I-A-empty hole in my empty head
Damn shorty, I told you this was bound to happen
I'm looking at your bum-stickity-bum, hun
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense b
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charlie Horse her
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
Feeling to me as killing the beat is
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding with you
Only deals I have is from the Sam's Club
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
but I'm man enough to face them today
Where must I go, who must I know
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
That you fucking had to be drunk to fuck me?
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
I love the way you lie [Bruno Mars]
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers Lickilty Split freestyle: Check this out, Check this out, yo
Where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Oh)
And scared to look in my eyes
You can't run from me Kim
I'll go handle this of course, unless you object"
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me, who dress like me
Inside it drives me crazy
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
With a gaping hole in it
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Doing doing doing The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this s***
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
And I'm coming to get that quarter back
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw-wit-da-baw dang-dang
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
You do know but actin' like you don't know When me and Fif' got together to do this music then move it
What, like I give a fuck, I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
'Cause, I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and him, both
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
Cuz he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Come on we're going for a ride bitch
Damn Slim, Mariah played you. Mariah who?
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
You think I'm ugly don't you
Too late
Something, something, something, something, I dunno Pop pills, pills I pop
And what I need from 'em? no favors (I know you feeling yourself right now
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Change the station I hate this song!
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog
I don't know why I'm still surprised
I could be iconic, and my conquest is
What, girl, I'm the crack-a-lator
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass! Sometimes I just feel like, quittin' I still might
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
In a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?
(And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving)
What you Mariah? Fly through twice
And heigh-ho, hand me my shovel I'm libel to dig my hole deeper
And though you say the days are happy
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
We bout' to have a party (turn the music up)
Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Thats ok you look like a fucking worm with braids
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
fuck it you can take the mic home with you
This couch, this T-V, this whole house is mine!
She don't need to see what I'm about to do
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Oh, I love the way you lie Now there's gravel in our voices
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Ha! go ahead yell!
(My penis in your anus)
O' Trice! [Obie Trice]
Living in this world without you Come on get out
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
And show these people what my level of skill's like
And said I was gross, go get a towel you're stomachs curling? Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassing me
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all them zippers
Now I gotta straight born infant
Inside your world
Born by whore lady
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Give a little "poot poot", it's OK (Fart Sound)
Then this thing turned out so evil
Right at you I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
Bumpin' 'Ice, Ice, Baby', screamin' Shady 'til I die
All I do is rap
another day of monotony Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
So i'm gonna turn with a great smile
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen,
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
I done said so much f***ed up s***, I was born a mistake
Damn! Mom
Get a grip Marshall
Damn.
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a
Now you bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Fuck you Ms. Cheney
Lyrics lyrics constant controversy
We're the ones who (chicka) made you The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Like her lips I'm agitated, aggravated To the point you don't suck my dick
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
And expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is.
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
Little bitch put me on blast on M-T-V
Got a 6 o'clock craving, stop, get Ciroc
Look at that, it's a Xanax.
'Cos our arms show tracks
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
Now what's your name girl
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers I'm suppose to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Show me everything's a blessing depending on the angles
I've calmed down now
When my grandma died, I realized I got an angel
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be! I'm sorry momma!
Shopping the demo with gun point
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
And to be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
You get the message am I getting through to you?
But scars still remaining the same
There goes another lawsuit
I'll call you again,
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I'ma treat these shell casin's like a soccer ball
Hipidi hoo bla
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer, or should I say Cobainer?
S*** half a Vicodin why can't I?
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it
I'm a man of my word so your fuckin' heads better nod

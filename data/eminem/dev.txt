(Let go of my hair, please don't do this baby)
To send my serenity powers
Well guess what, daddy's here
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
Since when did we begin to get 'dicted to dope
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in, the why, the who, what
You motherfuckers mustsanot know the tic tac songs
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
You front you'll have to get me off your ass
I got my baby, maybe the only lady that I adore, Hailie
But it feels so empty without me
Only time I ever been out and about is
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass
Just ask Jam Master Jay, they
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom
I turn around, find a gun on the ground
Now everybody from the 313
There's no way that you can save me, it's okay, go with him Hailie Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical
Forced to fight
Shoot out the back of his truck goes up in this motherfucker
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
He nose dove and sold nada
Serial killer hidin' murder material
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
But I'm running from it to be standing at the summit
but those days are gone [EMINEM] Alright,
I don't even know if I can say the word 'pee-pee'
I don't know why they let you out in the dark
Feelin' kinda breezy
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
So it's Shady After-mizz-ath back in that ass, you izz-ass
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs
Look at these rappers, how I treat them so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em yeah
Let Bizarre nut I take a couple uppers
Has an erection for me and thinks
I want to crush your skull till your brains leaks out of your veins
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
Then they anus'll ooze
you see how far these white jokes get you
Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
Here I'll scream with you!
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes, uh
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef Ha ha ha, I'm just playin' ladies
I am not afraid to die I guess we are who we are
Look, I can't change the way I think
Knife! Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
I don't see why these people always got my back
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
See me I'm climbing hell's gate
Forever I'm a be a Shady 7-4 Gangster
Love the way you lie I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
Have to be a fucking blowout to get me to retire
'Cause if I get burnt I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming
But not quite me 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
It go Ring-a-Chong, a-Ching-Chong-Chong-Chong-Ching
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
Trailer trash i choke u to your last breath
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
You god damn right bitch, and now it's too late
Between you and I
I am white I am a fuckin' bum
I ain't had no luck with this,
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
This is for children who break rules, people that straight fool
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
Haha Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
I'll tell the motherfucking slut to her face
But I get by my wicked ways, lady you can suck a dick till your neck aches
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
Ya'll are doomed
So I'm non complying at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
Niggas wearing flags, 'cause the colors match they clothes
(Grady!) Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down My tenement, too many now
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
And the fangs been out since then
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
Damn somebody hit me from the back
Whip out, whip down Tied him around my neck went down the fire escape of the Empire State
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
Nail her, 'Baby say hello to my little friend'
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
There is or there ever will be, disagree?
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers
So here I go is my shot.
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
But fuck it now I'm bout to draw the line
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
Yeah that rap was tight, but I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
Wait! What if there's an explanation for this shit?
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Yeah, right there, right there,
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
And walk my white ass back across 8 Mile My heart is telling me to be different
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies
Bleed! bitch bleed! bleed! So long, bitch you did me so wrong
Don, don, don, life, I do this for the crib
Up the center of the dance floor
See me and you we almost had the same outcome Heath
Ha! Ah ah ah ahhh (Oh god damn)(Ooh)
Hands up, reach for the sky
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
I dreamed of being that cool kid
That fit you, so put em on and wear 'em
That you might wake up with a guy On some new shit, I think I did too much
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
Like feeding Michel'le helium
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Believe me I'm leavin' a carcus today
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips I get all the money, pussy falls like rain
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
Who hate the world as much as each other
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
'Cause every time you do it's like an over load of fibs
(What about Eminem?)
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Decisions, decisions
You think that's bad you should hear the rest of my album
Then fuck it then break it up
Tell the public that I was so ugly
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
The only one who looked past
Swift told me to meet him here so its clear that this fucker
I think I love you baby I think I love you too
If I was black I woulda sold half
You should see when I'm stuntin' I flash the stones that be wantin'
Oh baby baby aah aah Um num num touch my body
We're in Sin City
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
(Please I love you, look we can just take Hallie and leave)
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
I'm like "My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?" White America!
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was am I?
I am white, I am a fucking bum
'Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
With his Karl Kani
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
At first, I'm like all right
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Tell these new artists that kings never die
Skinny girls
My brains gone, my souls warm, my spirit is torn
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go? I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
And I was not afraid to die Oh even if there's songs to sing
Haters started to appreciate my art
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
(crowd cheers)--- WOOOO Eminem (rabbit) freestlyes: This guy raps like his parents jerked him
I ain't never seen her butt like that
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
Just having to balance my damn self
Never ran with a click, I'm a posse
Got no ring on this finger now I'll never let another chick bring me down
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
I had to get Nate Dogg and his sing some shit Two to the one from the one to the three
(I can't I'm scared)
You can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
It ain't acid rap, I just rap on acid
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
Wouldn't even be taking this s*** if Deshaun didn't die
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
In the end I'm gone
Chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba
(Haha) Plasma
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
Who's that in the cool blue back
And be yourself man, be proud of who you are
Fuck 'em 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
'cause I want you triddip, yeah I be on that shiddit
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
Till I see some naked bitches dancin' around, drunk, touchin' each other Rum and Pepsi got your perception of me sketchy
Forget them other men, girl pay them little attention
1 pac , 2 pac, 3 pac, 4
To find his wife in bed with another man.
Man, I should of seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
But baby we're in Sweden
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Ain't changing my mind
Oh my God I'm crackin' up
i'm at a point of no return. Yea, (oh, oh), yea yea, oh I feel like dancing
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Look for coke to smoke No, oki dok
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixing our studio session
I got my baby back
Fuckin Nazi this squad ain't your type
Now it's blue blood in my veins
He's about to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Shady lose
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
And this load is like the weight of the world
With a about a million dollars with your mama
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
A poster child
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
Talk a little shit
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coping
The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing
I know you want me girl, in fact I see your grin (Now come in girl) When you walked through the door
I owe you for this one I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel
he pretends that .. [Chorus] can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
You do know but actin' like you don't know Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat
My children will carry me
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
And these niggas know I lay them down, make them beg
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willing to die for us
And you can never break my stride,
That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up
And a Heath Ledger bobblehead My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
And the lead singer of my band, my salsa
You do know but actin' like you don't know You know what this is
Oh but it feels so fackin' good! Ah ah ah ahhh (Oh god damn)(Ooh)
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
When I'm drunk as fuck
You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over,
Wanna hear something wick-wack?
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Fuck I was born during a earthquake To all the weed that I've smoked
Now bleed! bitch bleed!
But Lindsay please come back to seeing men
Gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
(Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear A shimmy shimmy go go motherfuckin' pop
And to the rest of the world, God gave you the shoes
And it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
A piece furniture, egg beater, thermos
I do it just to get your company hijacked If you like smack then I might too
I told him that you like it from behind Now, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this Nicki Minaj but I wanna stick
Wait I just forgot what I was thinking
And everyone just heard you let one rip Now I'm gonna make you dance
Cursed and blessed
And it seems yesterday it was just a dream
Where you going, I'm leaving you
You left me off your list Fuck you hip-hop
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
White girls
Little punk!
(Nigga what about your wife)
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod
Makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
You put your life in this, nothing like surviving the shot
Living in this world without you You really fucked me Kim
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
I know everything he's got to say against me,
But I guess that's just what sluts do
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,
So when you see me on your block you better lock your cars
Put ya face in it before I throw you in the basement again
50 told me to do situps to get buff
As you pour yourself another drink and I guess we are who we are
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I'll slap you off that bar stool
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, 'cause (They say kings never die
Serious
'Cause I'm gonna sock it to you, dyko, you don't like it
I'm as calm as the breeze, I'm the bees knees, his legs and his arms I'm a
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
Weed got her so chinky eyed
I'm kinda in the zone
Me and Shady deaded the past
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
100 pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound
Should I just give up
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girl's to take off their
Before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this And I would've done anything for you
And I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
Just sit there in one fuckin' place spinnin' in
I said look at him!
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas? I'm so bad
In 7 nights in the days and it's our Vegas
What size you where? I wear tens
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,
man they treat me like a legend
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Sprays one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,
Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuevo, first I kiss your navel
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I'm from Atlanta
Doing doing doing Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
And as you say goodbye to the grief
'Cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
I'm still standing here screamin' fuck the Free World Don't ever try to judge me dude
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Fuck a clock
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
It's lust its torturous,
With the ugly Kardashian
I say everyday she be givin' it up Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck
These leaders of the free world rookies
I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe that
No I won't sign your autograph, you can call me an asshole, I'm glad 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
"Shady what the fuck you saying?" I don't know help me!
But tonight, we're alright
Follow Bizarre's path and ran through it
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Shit,
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth [Chorus] It's Friday night came to this bitch right
This is what the fuck I do
I know you want me girl cause I can see you checking me out
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all with kindness
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Girl you just blew your chance
marshall youre never gonna make it
Even though I have an affinity for witty banter
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You don't know what the fuck i've been through But i know something about you
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So I've been sent here to destroy you
And you still don't know me So blow me bitch, I don't rock for cancer
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit you
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's

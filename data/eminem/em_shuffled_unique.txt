these food stamps and this weak shit
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em
'Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
Please stand up Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
They'll be over) Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur and ensure
You don't want that
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
there aint no way that you'll win
So bring clairvoyance to this bangin and I'mma keep on saying
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
I don't need no fucking manservant
Your bitch, a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
Never know what kind of car I'll be in
I have no life outside of that
I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me the strength
Girl you out ya alcholic mind
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better The souls escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
Just to get to this place
Spitten on your onion rings
You were supposed to love me
I will stand tall
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Something, something, something, something, I dunno Fuck it I can feel the heat rising
You went to Cranbrook
Its unfortunate but its Too late for the other side
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
'Cause I still don't give a fuck Zoning off one joint
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It isn't much but its enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
I'm cumming (oh yeah) OK I'm done, I already came twice,
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Shady made me
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
You need to take your white ass back across 8 mile to the trailer park
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
I'm posted up by the bar havin' a Mozeltoff
I'm a rolling stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
I will simple plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Don't put out? I'll put you out
And all of this controversy circles me and it seems
It will be so empty without me Now this looks like a job for me
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know
himself in his leg with his own gun,
While we alive when we die, we gon' be the gods Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Don't never try to judge me dude
I am not Triumph, I am Ah-nuld, get dowwwn! The way you shake it, I can't believe it
Like the media immediately points a finger at me
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
It's not what you expected, tho what you thought though
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand
Now you get to watch her leave,
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe 'Cause I can't be your superman
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
Initiate phase three! Missy now service me
Don't touch what you can't grab
I'mma give you the world
Kim, Kim!
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes Can we pretend that airplanes
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
There's no limit on how far I would go
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you Nobody asked for life to deal us
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
left to his plane and he missed it
"Marshall I just love you boy, I care about your well being"
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
y'all just do not fit the picture
I was revibed as soon as this bitch is gyrated
Your better off shooting yourself with Papa Doc's handgun
What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else that can relate to my story?
To do black music so selfishly (hey!)
Or statistic of this shit 'Cause after I spit the bullets
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
We just met and I just fucked you
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music
I don't see nobody but Fab Five and Hex
You think you cute, right?
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin' he could be workin' at Burger King
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find On an episode of Cribs, a blow below the ribs
'Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
This chick is clingin' onto me sobbin' and sighin'
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma!
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it You know, you actin' like you don't know
Never looking back, may hit the curb
Then you're gonna get decapitated
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or the pinky
I say everyday she be givin it up [Nate Dogg- Chorus]
Find the light, find the light, find the light Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more
I'm suppose to set an example, I need to be the leader
Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully
Its ridiculous
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
On what's hot, but I'm not gonna' conform
You and I
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And you don't have to walk no thousand miles In my shoes, just to see
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I'll say it all for you I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside,
I'm a little bit sicker than most,
And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations
The gift of my absence
'Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe
I cant keep chasing 'em
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
Gave me a chance
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
You hear me? Answer me! Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
Now, it all started with my father
Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves, a rebel
And that's just outta respect, for not running my mouth
I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet
And which motel which lake they found her in,
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you and love is "evol"
Ain't he raw? Yeah mainiac, that's Shady dog
"But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice
Body smelt like vomit Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope headed guy
And you're such a fuckin' babe I wanna go down on you, fuck you shave!
Goodness gracious
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
Watchin' me while I write this like
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Simmer down
And use it to get myself wealthy
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?
Couple sips of that then I gradually graduate
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think is
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
But I'm sorry mama for 'Cleaning Out My Closet', at the time I was angry
And why I just don't know Yeah,
Bothers me but now my father, he said sayonara and then split
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin' I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
Is he nuts? No! He's insane! Got a shit-eatin' grin
Grab you left (nut), make right one jealous what?
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong The guns spark when the shots go off
And I think my neck is breakin'
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
But guess what? You're gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely
So I must then get, off the bus then split
Please do not remove me from this movie theatre, please
So before you're leaving this Earth
Catch a cab, I wanna go down b-b-bow, bow
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build
And I lit a fire up under his ass
Get into an argument over a parkin' spot
Comin' at you So if you'll still be my baby girl
Cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it
My love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement park
Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit foot so fuck it
Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berzerk) all night long
Except for these bitches
"Ahh go fuck his brains out, if any's left in his head" If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
Trying not to be noticed because I'm crying and sobbing
Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
And that goes for Nick too
I leave you lost without a paddle floatin shits creek
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
"All systems ready for take off please stand by" Sometimes I feel so alone,
Uh huh
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Come on!
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
Son grow up to be an under-a-fucking-chiever
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
And when I bust yo ass I'm a continue to rock
Fuck a trailer
[Nate Dogg]
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
And if you don't like me then fuck you!
Hope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
With a Walkman on
I'll put it in your cunt
But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think
All I know is when I get there
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit
We do what we say, you say what we do Kid Rock, I couldn't be no Bozo
Now who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf 1, 2, 3 and to the 4
And the heroin, where were the parents at?
These niggas is trippin'
i got a better chance joining the kkk
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Damn I see Mary Ann. Mary Ann's saying, "Cut the tape, cut the tape"
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut
Have nothing, get it all but too much of it then lose it again
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't
No more crying, wipe them tears
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
'Til the walls are going up
And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad
'Fore I get lost with the gettin' off
I apologize even though I know it's lies
And it's probably were I got acquainted with the taste ain't it
They want you, Marshall
Call my bluff and I'll release every fucking thing I got
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
i'm at a point of no return. I'm hot motherfucker, get a plate bitch
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
There's a certain line, you just don't cross it, and he crossed it
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Look at myself!
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
You'll get dropped so hard that Elvis will start turnin in his grave
pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And what i tell ya you better use it
High off chronic
Driving around with a smashed front end
It's no secret
You gonna be late for soundcheck
Brung ya lay to this party, be my penis ejaculator later Tell ya boyfriend
Fuck, I'm gonna start lettin' off
(Kings never die)
I put both hands on your throat
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
so was Eddie Hasko, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Quit hollerin' 'Why, God?'
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust so,
and just lazy as shit
Now you're in each others face,
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Your man don't want it, Drumpf's a bitch
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack, they don't know what dope is
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium
Maybe we took this too far I want a new life
I'm a meet you at the club we goin' fuck these hoes up [Chorus] I never seen no shit like this is my life before
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
This guy aint no mother-fuckin MC,
Mumbling to the Jake, you going against me dog you making a mistake
Cry till you get puffy eyes red face
So stop with the snoring, pick your pint up
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore,
lookie how can six dicks be pussies?
But what happens when karma
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off,
How could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me
Hold up, she misunderstood me
I know everything he's bout to say against me,
And I'll kick that hoe, punt
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing about her
Hell, we don't have to trade our shoes
It just ain't realistic
Talk of Tony Yayo, go [Chorus] can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
When it whirls, when it twirls
But take this situation in which I'm placed in
You're submitting to skill, sitting still, I'm admitting, I'm beginning to feel
The song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses
I told you I ain't fooling from the gate, this ain't the first day of April!
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
The fire marshals no, the venue's too small
Big pills, mescaline
The hell if I know
Think about it before you walk in the door first
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting ourselves
Oops my C-D just skipped
bring me back to life, bring me back to life,
But if I offended you? Good
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
They just don't see my real side
Married to the game but she broke her vows
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me. These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Til we get to Las Vegas Whatever happens in my room, it stays in my room like movie night like cable
Obie rollin' with brews
Okay! Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
And I get to much P to ever be no homo
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumping me
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
So I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
Never stopping like we hypnotized
Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Squeeze it, then Squish it, then pass it to her friend
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) (And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
Ya little mother fucker,
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get So to the parents of America
Oh, I love the way you lie
What's the matter dog?
'Cause it feels so empty without me A-tiskit a-taskit,
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
She stomped him just cause he asked to put his hands
'Causing hospital accidents
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Got a wean her off it, weiner off it like she took my fucking penis
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drink anything It must be the ganja
Like I didn't write raps in all of my classes
And some come walk from out the parkin' lot
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
Look Look Now while he stands tough
And I'll let you in ya work
I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
From fat bitch to off seventy-thousand pounds of her
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
I should have known better when you started to act weird
But don't you place the blame on me
Boy's like how vanilla ice gonna diss you
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but I guess we are who we are
With wings I will fly I'm standing in the flames
They are kinda giving me confidence
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
Back again
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns Fuck that! Do that shit! Shoot that bitch!
makes no sense to play the game
Ya I know
pretend he procrastinated and had no motivation
You know the name of the crew
They got the discovery channel don't they?
I'm a kill you motherfucker!
Yeah, I'm right here
In your living room, ha-ha
'Cause there no such thing as half-way crooks
Speeding, I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Full of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
You did it, it's your fault
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
I don't have any lines to go right here so
I'll be right there for you
I just can't seem to get out this slump
And what I need from em, no favors
Skip over the huggy-bear and all the kissy face, please
I want to dig my way to hell Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder
If I stay passionate maybe I can stay Jay miraculous
Like this is our exit, now lets hit the highway and try not to get lost
I ain't stopping till be sprayed it
I got a new vibe, kinda like voodoo
No you ain't, come back
'Cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Crawl up on you like Christopher Reeves I can't describe the vibe I get
Don't I give you enough of my time
I hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see
As soon as we give the orders, never to extort us
Fuck you asshole, yeah bite me
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
But it's over now, It's too late to save our love
My eyes ain't clear
In the meantime it's always mean time I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I feel like dancing I smell something in the air that's making me (high)
at least that's what her train of thought is
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn
'Cause these others low key with the snaking faking
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy right?
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
And the 10 Karat Kid with my triggers cockin'
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight
Oho whoa-ho,
(Yeah, right) Shut your mouth, you dirty slut
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
In each other's shoes, at least
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
So hold up your lights
I sit back, with this pack, of zigzags
Laugh at every single joke I crack
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
You ate it yesterday I ain't hear no complaints did I?
I think I'm losing control
What are you doing here? Here to stay
And five I hit, ah, shit
I'm moving on forget you oh,
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
Hello? F*** you then
First thing you said
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Hope you're trapped in my medicine ball
Love, love,
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
"Daddy look what I made"
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle rubber
Fell down and I got right back up
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
In the video with the goatee?
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
This guys a hillbilly this ain't Willie Nelson music
Maybe we took this too far, I want a new life Hi! My name is (what?)
And I'm tryna run and get my motherfuckin' gun
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
I don't rap to get the woman fuck bitches
So where's all the Mad Rappers at
Small girls
This bitch don't know what abortion is
Garage looks like Precision Collision
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?
(Shit is mine, I gotta do this, gotta do this) Alright, stop! (Huh?)
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
I'm a hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for, sing along If you could count the skeletons in my closet
With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred assaults, and four murders
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
The only fear I have is of loathing
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
I think about more than I forget
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Please!
this shit is a Horror flick but a black guy doesn't die in this movie.
I know you want me baby
Uh, it's time to raise it, then
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
I'm rolling sweets, I'm smoking sour
Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick
But enough is enough Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
He slept through his plane and he missed it
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
And its absurd how people hang on every word
Just look at me like I'm ya closest pal
I'm just trying to unwind
What you crying about?
I'm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blade Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
Crown around it, thorns on it
Lookin out, cause I'm standing in the flames
(Ni-ni-ni) "Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
Just get high until the kids get home from two homes relax
Y'all know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
You got me captivated
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter?
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
I pack up my nose with coke
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
I don't know it's just the way I am Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
Ward, I Think you were a little hard on the beaver
You ain't never ever gonna hear me say I ain't Here to stay
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
My boy future is an Uncle Tom
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
So you know where I came from
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
The thing above the balls between my legs and I think
Mariah, it ever occur to you that I still have pictures?
They're for the judges daughter, but his grudge is against me
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind It must be the ganja
Tryin' to get this damn label off
Circle jerk, touch my body Who is that? Where are you going? Mm come back
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
So ahead of my time late means I'm early, my age is reversing
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
take pictures of my rear end so you wont forget my ass
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin' And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
However you prefer to do
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag [Bruno Mars]
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I'm about taking a risk, that might fuck up your life
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
We're running right back, here we go again
Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
(Kuniva you aight)
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
But I love you so much it hurts,
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
Until Ja' start yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
You know what time it is, so why ask?
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
Feminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him
'Cause anytime things went wrong
(Pedal to the metal) Yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
I don't know who you been listening to
And yell, "Wait!", pleading—but screaming is pointless
You's the projects nigga [Chorus]
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
The next day my mother said "I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!
Then I let you just go and just give
Blow it out your a** As I fall deeper into a manic state
Throw your spine out of alignment
And the crackers' ass, little crack a jack beat
I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors
S*** must have knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all
But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Think I'd be back, did ya?
And since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
That made me put up with her psycho-ass over 6 months
You better ask somebody [Nate Dogg- Chorus]
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage
These shrooms make me hallucinate
So why he get 90 and we only get ten percent
Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
I'ma kick the ballistics
Let that little rascal nibble on my asshole, uhh,
Like chopping 'til I'm dropping, still if that don't
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
No Dad, I said no, I don't need no help peeing
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Acting stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up
Ever since I came along
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
I just get on the mic and spit it, and whether you like to admit it (rip)
Til we get to Las Vegas Yo, I can't sing good
, none This guy aint no mother-fuckin MC,
Chance to party all the way to Sunday
Sit down bitch
This bitch can twist like a damn contortionist
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adams apple sliced
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
I watch her grow up with pride
Ey yo turn the beat up a little bit
Next time, there will be no next time
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin out
Watch what we visualize on the rise, be the G.O.A.T.
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Heroine mescaline, pencil legs wanna try?
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark
They'll lock you away!
i hate to do this i would love for this shit to
This is the only thing I, thing I know Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
And if you still ain't finished it I'll use the same shit again
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski
Come be in Shady's world Oh boy you drive me crazy
Yeah backwards like motherf***ing Bob and Silent Jay
Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
But I came here to get on goose and tropicana
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
Let down my guards swear to God
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Obliterate anyone in the way
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter?
Oh gee, is that supposed to be me
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
From where they need a handout
Please stand up Haha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us,
Baby you're so precious
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
Bobby creek is in the place
But I don't give a shit I'm fine as long as
'Cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
Kick it back in its face, my God
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
Stop in a limo, hop in the window
It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screw-drive-rs
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate (Now break it down girl) When you walked through the door
And I just do not got the patience
I'm in the mood to strut, my A-K ain't even tuck
And fuck this battle I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Plus Dre told me stay out, just wasn't my beef, So I did
I leave the club with my tab still open
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
It was neither,
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
I don't see us ever being together ever again
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
Baby, get down, get down Baby, get down, down down
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
I ain't inherit shit but a millionaire under 30
And I always end up giving these bitches some complex
And I'mma be back for you, the second that I blow
Might wanna back up the data
Shady's back
We can only get brighter
Eighty degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off!
I done touched on everything, but little boys
My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
Shady dog, what be going through that fuckin' brain of yours
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
The weight has been lifted
It's a different ball game, call names and you ain't just rapping
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
When I was underground
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
Little sleepy head
And lay with eighteen guys naked and let myself show, let myself show
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
We got you on tape
Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some,
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
(Pedal to the metal) I take a couple uppers
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade,
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me please
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so so
I saw your headlights as I looked back
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I've tried in this department but
But then she comes back to me My baby girl keeps gettin' older
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon Roman!
Fuck ya'll if you doubt me
Let's try to use imagination Can we pretend that airplanes
This is niether the time or the place to get macho
(Mm, I don't know!)
Matter fact bake me a birthday cake
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in endin' up
I'mma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
Laney uncles crazy, ain't he?
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know
Bitch are you retarded?
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
When you freaks see me out in the streets
It was a black Mitsubishi
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Too have another half of gla** of wine sound asinine
That was never my object for someone to get killed
So I never say goodbye cruel world
But those days are gone, they're just memories
The pictures we been painting, my nigga
You can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
All because I'm the lead singer of my band So I get off stage right and drop the mic
He decides to rob a liquor store
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha) Yo, it's my life, my own words I guess Have you ever loved someone so much
I stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
Cause I'll break your face, have your ass running
Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome
Girl don't be so frantic I'm just a hopeless romantic
I guess it was never meant to be
When you get your fucking ass graded like a math paper
When they raggin'
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
When you're so good that you can't say it 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
So I can't cum in her, fucks like a porn star, looks like Jenna,
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed with
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
Because I don't belong in this world
And he just fell asleep in his car eating Three Musketeers in the rear seat Sometimes I feel so alone,
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog
So bounce, bounce, c'mon, bounce, I said, c'mon, bounce
I'm on the patron
hot beams steady shot clap your ass
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off
(Some want a champion to fall I still wonder why I laugh at 'em
Cause now I'm in the Aston
Burp, belch, then go back for a second helping
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking
am i really this cold
1 pac 2 pac 3 pac 4
Let's get the pineapple schnapps going, no one'll knock cause I'm a hang a sign up
That cougars a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon write itself"
Bitch you make me hurl
We're the ones who (chicka) made you Back by popular demand
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
It's what we into it's simple
Yeah that's right (It don't hurt me) And I don need you (No more)
Command it, and I'm a be the boss of you now goddammit
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
Nothing but a hole inside your skull where you eye close
Oh baby baby aah aah It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
Two little beautiful girls
I knock a nigga face off
The further you put it behind ya
Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
Beer goggles, blind
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
I mean girl just touch my body Where's my snare?
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
P-p-p pow-pow chicka-chicka wow-wow
Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
And how they attacked the victim,
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
Walk, talk and act like me, it just might be the next best thing,
You thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got 'er
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron on
With 5'9 [unverified] to hold this bitch down
If I could just get over this hump
But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine"
Saying "Don't Disturb", shorty I'm so superb
I'm Mary Poppins, B
And ever single teenager that hates school Fuck off My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
This guy's a choke artist
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,
How did you get so big?
Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow
Came to sip vodka, shit
'Till we get to Las Vegas (Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'
If some shit ever just pop off I'm suppose to be beside 'em
As in a new case of child molestation accusation
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
I'm calling all girls
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
It's fucked up ain't it, how we can come from practically nothin'
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
"You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'"
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And butt fucked this game up
And gay into the A.M
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
When and where and the how, 'til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out
S***.
You rollin' wit' a player
What's the matter dawg, you embarrassed?
You're pac he's pac You're pac none This guy ain't no motha fuckin MC
I'm single now
Even if it means I'm selling my soul, just to be the undisputed again
To rock fellow, when I'm not even in my harshest
I have needs! I'm NOT done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle and ride it, like a motorbike
It's the K-K-Kid Rock with the K-K-Kid Rock shit
Now I'm just the cats meoww, ow
A sky full of lighters [Eminem]
Knowin' still got a few chunks on your shoestring
But hey,
This ain't what I'm in Hip Hop for, it's not why I got in it
'Cause I'm happy Yeah, I'm happy
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse 'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Haters stay on his nuts
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Wood grain steering wheel this bitch feel like a pirate ship
Alright stop
Keep making that face till it gets stuck like that
You ran me into the ground, but what comes around goes around
Others get the hit with the laugh
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs
I miss my past
I don't believe it, it's almost to good to be true
Even when I'm right
Get 'em I'm alive again
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
(Damn) Let me tell you
That's ammo for my arsenal
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
Living in this world without you On the first page of our story
I heard you was freaky from a friend of mine Now I hope you don't get mad at me
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old, and
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
And I'm armed with a firearm
All the way to the parking lot, fellow
And they connected wit' me too because I looked like them
I got your girl in my arm
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
My vest is barely able to handle it, its to thin
We can hit the telly when the fun stops
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass! I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
Instead of tryina escape through my comics,
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Get up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck's sake I'm about to lose my mind
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags and as I'm leavin'
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
No I had an interview not you two
When's the last time you saw a villain with a cape?
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening,
It's like this rope waitin' to choke
Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it
Yeah me and Nate d-o double g
I'll be one tough act to follow
Few bags of the the grass, zig zags, I'm with the doc so
Nick, is that your wife?
When I overdosed would have caught a flat If it makes you sick to your stomach pass it
Let's cash that one in
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit I ride like Senna in the Indy 5
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke It must be the ganja
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
You loved him didn't you?
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn Y'all niggers intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Child support, your father he ain't sent the shit
I know I should let bygones be bygones
yo, yo Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
And this bag, of this weed
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Thought I was incredible and killed the hulk I wanna, roll away like a Rollerblade
For a dad to show up who never did
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
You'd give an arm for
Crusin' on the freeway
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,
On top of the affidavit Graduated from master debater
May I have your attention please?
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show" I'm sorry momma!
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
You like this
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
So let me just revel and bask
can you see me can you see me get your visine on
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
What the fuck's happening, I think I'm fucking melting
I don't think you realise what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
Like I'mma sit and fight with you over some slut, bitch-cunt
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
It's nuttin' but some cash You know, you actin' like you don't know
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom [Rabbit]
1Pac, 2Pac, 3Pac, 4
"Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
'Cause with you I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Surely hip hop is never a problem
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third
So when I do 'shrooms you all better give me two rooms 'Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up
But on eggshells I was made to walk
And to let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Two white boys who spike punch and light joints
You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad
Nobody's ever gonna be what you were
Just know that I was alright
Everybody knows
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words? I'm so bad
Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter
Obie
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
Now grab this Cuisinart
Does this look like a big joke?
Females stay beatin 'em, bet you they'll lay bleeding
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
Until my legs (Until my legs)
It's nothing
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Now I'm special? Oh, I didn't feel special when I was with you
"Well this is called ass rape, and we're shooting the jail scene" If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Kiss my dick, hit my cash, I'd rather have you whip my ass
And that f***er still talks to me he is all I can f***in' hear
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I told y'all mothafuckas I was comin' back
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick
No homo', but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
'Cause the kids don't listen gettin' lots of flack I be the do wa diddy up and down you block
Ah I'm coming ah yeah,
My book of rhymes got 'em cookin'
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get, but I can't take a shit
Jessica Alba put a breast in my mouth
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong
To do it again, then, if he does it again
Before they ever noticed my face
I ain't playin' go find you a white crayon
And what I need from 'em? No favors I'm about getting the job done, boy up every night
Ha Ha
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
Stop it, stop it!
You know whats coming you motherfuckers don't even know do you?
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees
Did I take it too far?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours
There you go
Life is wacky now
And it's sick that all these battles
And I don't give a damn if they're white or blue
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
If you felt these migrains, see these maggots eat my brain
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Doin' jumpin jacks whilin' get whipped on my back Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
How does it feel, is it fantastic, is it grand?
Just someone who rebels in straight masochism
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem V.D.
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
I came to claim but the game ain't
Is refresh your memory when you said, "I want you" Now should I keep going, or should we call truce?
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
Sippin everything from white grain
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
You little shit you want to sit there and play innocent
And take away there freedom like you did to me
I call the play, now do you see why?
Now let's pretend like it was all-good
Have that I don't, are you telling me tenderness?
Spend a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit!)
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
Paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face, I'm insane
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream I'm standing in the flames
I just got some and I'm going back soon I take a couple uppers
Thought I had the Midas touch
Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I just shit it better than 90 percent of you rappers out there
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
Just as soon as I walk in
I starting to feel distant again
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
The future seemed so bright
And if the plane goes down
You're Pac, he's Pac, Yo Pac; none
You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat
Doing, doing, doing The fuck is wrong with you?
Who woulda thought
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out
And I don't mean apartment
Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten
What you tryin' to be, my new wife?
Rock from Soho to Arizona
Like we used to be when we were teenagers
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Wiped you and powdered you.
That sound, vomit, thirst and how common underground commons eat
I'll hang you till you dangle and chain you with both ankles
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit
'Cause all I do is curse and fuck
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping em up
And I think with my dick so come blow my mind
And only spread her legs to let me hit once Yeah, what you gonna say? I'm lucky?
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin'
Leaving them pale faced medium sized welt
Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
Nothin' can take her from me Woo!
Not weed, I meant coke, dumbass, sit down We don't bullshit, better ask around
Bitch so what?
Shit With my pants half hangin' off my ass and shit
This free worlds got you gassed up
Now everyone report to the dance floor
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
Ohh god damn, here I go again, I'm gonna cum I am! Ah ah ah ahhh (Oh god damn)(Ooh)
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
To be kicked down
loc's on, chucks low, black beanie dog
I hate you! I hate you!
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on White America!
It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze
I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny
Now I'm pissed off Sit back, homie, relax
Is word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest This is my legacy, legacy, here
And sat down did an ALS challenge, huh
he's gonna have a hard time explaining to hailey and lainey
The only thing I ever gave up is using. No more excuses.
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit and start over from scratch and write new ones
Titanium brain that's full of, surprises
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the source'll quote it
And let it be known from this day forward
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
Now just wait til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
Ha ha, you feel that baby?
I'm like "niggas took the flow but I'm still standing too"
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
That's daddy baby
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Without you Hi! My name is (what?)
You take my breathe away
To try to stop my concerts early
No favors, no favors If she was flavor I won't savor
That's why we seize the moment, and try to freeze it and own it
I can't wait, I'm going back! Ha ha woo! Dr. Dre, 2020, yeah Ladies and gentlemen
In the second week we were dry humping
I would call them in) - "Hey, I'm outside"
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug-addict who bags on his mama
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
on some real shit though i like you
As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same
You know you want it in your butt
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
'Cause why care when I'm awesome?)
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
Not the expression, no
rozay bitch let the champagne drip
Straight treating 'em like a cell mate
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't abort
Grab another one from out the stable
Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me
They said save it boy
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Good lordy-wody you must be gone off that water bottle
Yeah, so what I'll do
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
Man and I was on my way there
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
I have you feelin' aight, I get you high as a kite
Man I never thought that I could ever be a drug addict
Nobody listens to techno
Down the street screaming
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
(It's not that!)
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun,
and i'm ready for that i'm just saying
And in the front drive talking to myself
You morons think that I'm a genius
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And piss on the lawns of the White House
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept going I'm tryna be headstrong
Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
Self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof 'cause trust me
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves
I got my grimy Shady with me
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend?
A normal life is boring, but super stardom's close to post-mortem
Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?
And I produced the track
Either that or the mother fucker's been puffin' reefer
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
Find the light, find the light, find the light Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Makes no sense to play the game it ain't no way that'll you win
I want to dig my way to hell Oh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty
Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre actin' ill
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
Compared to a weed high
'Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can
'Cause you got the windows up blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prism The devil ain't on the level same as him
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and W-I-C shit
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
We'll be friends
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me
One shot two shot three shot four shots
Everything, except his tank top and his training bra
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Classic now, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao
I'm cleanin' out my closet Love, love
D12 throws the bomb to gas your town
Ha! ha! got you!
No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
Let's pretend things would've been no different
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch
Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
I'm cleaning out my closet Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
You still fly kites daily Catch me in my Mercedes
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
About to get my back tatted again
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
All I hear is
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, cause the shit I hear is crazy
But, agree to disagree
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
You want to throw me out? that's fine!
They moved on to the next schmo who flows
Fuck you, you did this to us
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
With violent words and empty threats
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Overseas, church, Vatican
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
What do you mean, 'freeze'? My computers will be seized
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now?
How could you let him sleep in our bed?
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt
But you may wanna find something more stable
Who
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad I think
I'ma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry momma
Is that a tank top or a new bra
Bitch, get the fuck out of my face
It's like a jungle in this habitat
Misses Mathers your son has been huffin' ether
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva)
Telling an old lady to "touch my body"
I almost break down and cry
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
Oh yeah girl see baby they call me Mr freaky,
I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
But still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute cause Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
The moment you've all been waiting fo
The rest of my body is still being operated on
"Testing attention please"
Word, w-word man you heard, but don't be discouraged girl
Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd
From the day the song called ''Hi! My Name Is'' dropped
With your hands out looking up to me, like you want something free
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked then
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Man, you must be up out your mind
I was heavy once into drugs
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
Hopping out with two broken legs
You rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real"
And made me Robin Williams crazy
Give me an awkward eye
I'm just willing to be the bigger man
To get their hands on every dime you have
And you take that to new extremes
But that's actually what has ended up happenin'
Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
You don't wanna become another victim
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
I'm drown in so I guess I'm a mess
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
Before they ever once compared me to Andre
'Round the outside, 'round the outside Guess who's back, back again
Yeah we fucked
He's scared to look at his fuckin year book
I ain't never suppose to show it, my crew ain't suppose to know it
it's about time you admit it who you kidding man
With the rhyme I'm spittin' while I'm s***tin' on the competition
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you?
Leave hand prints all across you
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
Put your mothefucking hands up
So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes It must be the ganja
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
Comeback as if I went away
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
I'm squirting and she's not gettin' off,
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harda to hold
Always make sense to you right now
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy)
Look real close cause strobe lights lie
But Shady's cute
With a gat nigga and my tire is flat
It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
And we're starting this party from dusk Now everybody from the 313
In this tug of war you'll always win
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump in the place
See me, we fly
I'm not Mr.Friendly, I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty
But those days are gone) Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Oh wait a minute oww put it back in, in in in
Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
Are what keeps me satisfied Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
Of daughters startin' to blossom
Middle America, now it's a tragedy, now it's so sad to see
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
Gin and tonic demonic
I'm a hair away from getting carried away and getting sued I was gonna stop at 16, that was 32
Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
Flip them, don't expect no help, now I could have either just
This free world's got you gassed up
In the mansion
And look at where it's at
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
You bet your sweet ass I do
I don't know how or why or when
I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself
Eminem came Obie stat and proof too
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
Let it shi-i-i-i-ine
So she hear me wrong
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
I'mma sing for you
Your superman, your superman 'Cause I can't be your superman
it's just what comes from fame
Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
And I can't change the way I am
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
(You know what Dre? I don't like your attitude) (It's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute)
I'm cleanin' out my closet Ha, I got some skeletons in my closet
I have no snare in my headphones
You got any shrooms?
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
Am I too loud for you?
Ain't no possible reason , I could think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
You ass dicks had gastric bypass
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
They tried to shut me down on M-T-V
But now that I got this little company
Look look Now while he stands tough
go home write some shit make it suspensful
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (Go berserk) all night long We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
I'm divorcing you
But I promise momma's gon' be alright It's funny
Is he nuts? No! He's insane! If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Thinkin' I'm sayin' the shit
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
My '90s was like the Navy, you was like the Bradys
But then she comes back to me Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
I'm too cool to go back
Someone help me I think my face is melting
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause
This guy's a gangster; his real name's Clarence
Forced trauma, blunt
Even angels have their wicked schemes
Top 5 in this mu'fucka' and if I don't make the cut
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me? Now this looks like a job for me
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life I told the world one day I would pay it back
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
That's an Ambian each nap how many Valium, three
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Cause there's a puppet on my hand The way you shake it, I can't believe it
Ow fuck I think it's stuck
Driving around town with my fucking whereabouts in a doubt
No love found It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
Oh, what's a matter Kim?
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life May I have your attention please?
And they want to get one, 'cus they think the shit's cool
You do not want to try this at home my novato (novice)
i'm at a point of no return. One thing bout music when it hits you feel no pain
Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross, you'll dig this
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard I broke my collarbone
I just wanted to fit in, every single place, every school I went
Floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Oh baby baby aah aah It's Friday and it's my day
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
So let 'em bic's raise 'cause I came with 5'9′ but I feel like I'm 6'8″ [Bruno Mars]
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B;, I sing song
'Cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
(Woo) Meanin' I'm on fire off the top
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
Don't think I'm loyal
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
It's gon' say 'The whole rap game passed away'
"Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'"
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) Guess who? You miss me?
Good evening, this ain't even a weed thing,
But I promise momma's gon' be alright And if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
(And you don't hurt me) That's right (You don't hurt me) and I don't need you (No more)
And use my enemy's words as strength
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Yeah?
I ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight
This guy's a gangster?
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what it's kinda like
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
Fuck it just shut up and listen Ey yo
Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Lose Yourself video I was in the back
Nigga on and on till the break of what
Drop in the lap of a tax evader
From here on out it's the Chronic II
Time to show you the mo kick ass flow in the cosmos
I dunno where I'm goin'
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits
Run along!
Your superman, your superman We touch I feel a rush
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
I told you I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did you?
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
You really did a number on me
With a magnum
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
Baby mama drama screamin' on and Too much for me to want to Stay in one spot,
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
I'm climbing out this abyss
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym
And you'd think with all I have at stake
After coming home from a hard day's work,
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Wait is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie
Started thinking my name was fault
Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
Climbin up this mountain your weak
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue You scary ass it was false alarm
These shell casin's is just like a bag of paper
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet
chopped it, and stuck it up between her armpits
Oh shit the shoot is comin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin' Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
Now go out there and show em that you love em more than us
And ate the rapper, chewed him up and spitted him out
You hungry you fucking brat?
You won't amount to shit quit day dreaming kid
And I just can't sit back and wallow
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Shove it up my butt,
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
All because I'm the lead singer of my band They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
I'm a grown man
Came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
I love the way you lie I can't tell you what it really is
'Cause, he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye?
Strive for perfection, this much is true
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you
With a blue new rag
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
Twenty five to life I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
And get live with that which gets me high
I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic (I-I-I-I-Is)
No love lost,
I'm just doin' my thang, you know The Units the game
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
Been gettin' laid and paid, that's why I never complain
That's fucked up!
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wildin'
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away
My band The hottest boy band in the world
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
You do what we say and we'll do what we wanna do We're fuckin' up your city and we're fuckin' up your program
Spell it backwards I'll show ya Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
And I ended up in this position I'm in
Drugs kill, bitch I'm for real
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (Oh no) Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Slim Shady! So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
Bitches, hoes niggas is runnin'
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
I know I let you down
"I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
Fuck a needle here's a sword body pierce with this
Here today, gone tomorrow
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
A brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives (Shittin' on rappers)
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
To appreciate me, differentiate me
if you thinking i'm gonna quit before i die dream on
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
I'm tired of all you
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
She killed the fucking dog with the medicine she done fed it
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, gang bang bang
Yeah, I feel it too.
But I'm movin' on with mine
Bizarre, your mom is passing out
To these blue and yellow purple pills I'm at a rave, looking like a slave
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
Cause that Christmas you know the Nomonia thing
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
Clique too big, bread? Gotta break it
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
When I drive by six people
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Stiffen up that upper lip
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
But wounds, wounds heal
Helped him get back to the top
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Neither do I
And kids flipped
How the fuck could you do this to me? So long, bitch you did me so wrong
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 'The Eminem Show' I'm sorry momma
you wont amount to shit, quit day dreaming, kid
50 fears no man, warrior swing swords like Conan
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
Go call you a lawyer
Brit forget K-Fed let's cut off the middle man
And Dr Dre said
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
I just settled all my lawsuits, "Fuck you, Debbie!" Now this looks like a job for me
That was years ago
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
Like Ndamukong the drama can build
I got bars, sentencin'
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
I'm African-American in America
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
So it's only right that I right till he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
A lyricist without a clue
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,
I am a movie, camera block
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
Give him the bottom of the nine like a baseball scoreboard (whatever)
Now here's a plate full of painkillers
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch
I'm riding shotgun tryna get a gauge
They just playing sick, they ain't shit They ain't saying shit, spray 'em Fifty
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
Some girls are bout it 'bout it
4Pac, 3Pac, 2Pacs, 1
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
See what these kids do, is hear about us totin' pistols
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
So here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
Well if you want Shady, then this is what I'll give ya
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
matter fact dogg heres a pencil
'Cause it feels so empty without me Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Ha bitch you get (No love) You showed me nothing but hate
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
It's your chance for a little romance or
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
But you've extinguished this living hell
It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night
Cock it, put it to my brain, scream Die Shady! And pop it
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
look snoop dogg just got a fuckin' boob job
Meanwhile my intentions pulled me in other directions
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
Man f*** am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache
Is pity from no one, the city is no fun
That's for Sandra Bland ho and Philando
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Couldn't snuff young 'cause
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
But when it's bad, it's awful
there you go
Feels like no one can beat me Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up and follow me
With that Detroit city shit ain't shit switched we're on the same script
Take another shot of Jagger, shake it so nervously
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
I'm not Mr.'N Sync and I'm not what your friends think
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Free, yes free, right back on the streets
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scalar
If she don't stick to the script, then I'mma just keep goin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's Syndrome
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Good god, dip, do a little slide
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute,
I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast Fuck off Yeah, right in your motherfuckin' ass bitch
Helplessness
With fake tits and a bad dye job
And all the other guys just despise me because These chicks don't even know the name of my band
I know sometimes things may not
Hey yo Em
I know you got a job, Ms. Cheney
Damn! Where's my snare?
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so Lately I've been hard to reach
The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
Is probably a hundred and ten percent different
That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned And I am, whatever you say I am
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Or the Hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Here, tell this people something they dont know about me. Too late for the other side
Literally give an arm for
As you barely even perspire from the heat
(With they car?)
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take,
Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
And with a little time that should do the healin'
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a f***in' year
That you just struck pay dirt
And still I stick with this
and all's well that ends okay
It don't matter,
Let's see if you can fit your feet In my shoes, just to see
Eminem offend? No! Eminem insult
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate
That's all it took
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid
Up and tried to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh! I'm so bad
It's a movement, you can't stop it
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
But everybody just feels like they can relate
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) shake your body Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim When you walked through the door
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringe worthy
Dre aah aah
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Take it and take a nap, eat it,
Oh fuck yeah, wait he's not out he's still crawling around up there,
And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Blend in with the rest of the room
Kings never die I can hear the drummer drumming
Look at my daughters face
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
Oh my god, I wanna fackin' fack
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
Ew ew ew ew Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
I know what you wanna hear 'Cause I know you want me baby
One without a cause
To wait but I know to unpack his bags
His real names' Clarence
That's what they want
This stage is my pedestal, I'm unstoppable, incredible
that makes me believe you really don't have an interest in livin'.
Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I) I will not fall
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just did the impossible
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
Your a disgrace
they could blow away with the wind
She showed me a movie like "Nightmare on Elm Street"
Someones gonna touch my body
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
The water that I drank
Yo, check it out Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Well tell her to shut her mouth, then I'll leave her alone
That's my new lifetime policy
I've been to the muthafuckin mountain top
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
hey hey Bobby, Bobby, Bobby Creek [Bobby Creek]
How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row,
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't de-fuse the wick
In the bathroom without someone standing by it
A sky full of lighters [Royce Da 5'9"]
I split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin' My heart is telling me to be different
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
So bad they should put his a** in prison
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
But I bet if I licked her, she'd try to chase me (Ha-ha)
thats why i didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king...
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
In the middle of the aisle whilin I don't give a f*** I don't play!
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy bye
'Cause I'm on a rip this mystical slick shit
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
My head is swollen, my confidence is up
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bomb who shoots
Chew me up and spit me out
With this pent-up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office
(Well I can't just leave 'ey alone, what if she wakes up?)
I'm cleanin' out my closet Now, I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
Bodies drop hit the floor music's off
Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
And you know you are their armor
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
In smoke with all our memories This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
Vain Vicadin, vrinnn Vrinnn, Vrinn!
Live in the muck, never giving a fuck
Take your mother's warning, Roman
My body aches when I ain't
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
Straighten up little soldier
But not for him to take my place, are you out you're mind?
Once again, his conscience comes into play (Shit!)
He can give her some, she can give him some
Young, dumb and fulla cum
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
turn your wide screen on
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit!
He can't get with me spitting this shit wickitly lickity shot a spick-a-spickety splyt lickety
I want to dig my way to hell I've been a career a**hole
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Too much pride
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin'' G
and play with his friends
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outty,
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
"Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
So fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now, ain't you momma?
In your caboose
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
'Til I created so much muthafuckin' turbulence
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
From these phoney, little fishy and sissy fake G's
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
but oh well if you gotta go then you gotta go
Homie, this sick, you can normally ask a hater Don't it make sense
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,
And mom, I know he's not around
The name is snoop too
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's
Throwing her over furniture
so they tell me that they love me i know better than that it's just game
Would you capture it or just let it slip? Yo
Fuck you with the free-ness of speech this
So southern ain't just part of my grammar
Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
We're going to have a problem here Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
I got the same exact tat
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
Now let's go, just give me the signal
And when I'm old and gray
You'll never take my pride, killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent is getting no
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
Come sip on my gum drops
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
I done messed around and forgot my tec
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
'Cause she's kinda famous
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone
It's no ones fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
But I can rap so fuck school
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
You're kicking me out? It's fifteen degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
What do you mean, 'freeze'? Please, I'm a human being!
Every time I hear (Hey dude I love your band)
then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my sausage as a hostage
I ain't never seen a ass like that
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Fucking peas in my plate
As long as the song's getting airplay, I'm dissing you
They keep screamin' your name
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
And my boy,
Thinking he can try and solve them
You little dizzy bitch, eatin' spaghetti again
Crazy, I am back and I am razor-sharp, baby And that's back with a capital B with an exclamation mark
Daddy's so proud of you
And I ain't givin' in you're gonna
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
I'm taking my life back
This is the only thing I, thing I know I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents
And when the cops came through
niggas swag jack, but this l.a. shit
Psych! I joke, I joke, I keed, I keed
Let's do the math
Ooh yeah girl run that game
Everytime I see that show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
Ha, bitch you get no (Love) 'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
One just like a hood rat chick who was curious
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open, that I wont be makin' a mistake ('Cause I'm a) I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
Even if it meant acting stupid, Aunt Edna always told me
Just by the way that you keep lickin' 'em dicks
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
patron top wash straight from the liquor store
Cause the DJ playin' my song
Unless you're a swallow
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
Indigestion my suggestions's Kaopectate
Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed
Oh, I love the way you lie So maybe I'm a masochist
Shit's gonna get thick again, they say the
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em
You have the same passion that I have
You catch the bad one
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
So everybody, everybody
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Slip it in her bubbuly, we finna finna have a party We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But I smoke dope in a cab
OK, you want me up in a cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
But right now I'm on the inside
It's 'bout to be a scary drop
What I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
Ha bitch you get (No love) You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah)
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
Ha ha ha
But f*** it, suck from the tucket
Too good to be true?
But then I got a little bit older
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
I told you I can't sing
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
That's on Nick's back I'm obsessed now
I swear to god I hate you
(Is you hit?)
We became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
Nah I guess not, what the fuck oh my god it was
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
I guess we would have to walk a mile
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre So what do you say to somebody you hate
And to think I was gone I was afraid to
When it spins, when it swirls
And I think my arm is gone, it's probably numb
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
'Cause there ain't no such thing as halfway crooks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
I'm embarrassing you, and don't you dare say it isn't true
I can't find mommy, where is she?"
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
I should cut his mic off when the musics starts
I only get naked when the baby sitter tells me
Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha)
If they were brown
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at? OK
What am I sayin'?
It's survival of what? This is survival of the fittest
Plus I'm thinking that they're mistaking my kindness for weakness
And I'm Superman, mmm
They said they found me on the bathroom floor Sometimes I feel so alone,
Tongue is foul shoot off at the fucking mouth
This eighty G's a week to say the same things threece!
People make jokes, 'cuz they don't understand me
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
So if love is a chess game, check mate
So I decided just to pick this pen
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Excedrin
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I'm all outta gas, not so fast! uh your finger just went in my ass!
And we're starting this party from dusk OK, let's go Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?
Did I s-st-stutter, motherfucker? Fuck the mall
In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
To these blue and yellow purple pills Cool, calm, just like my mom
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better You can do anything you set your mind to, man Whatever
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive
Your as addictive as they get
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
In Harlem only in Boston
The way she's grindin' that pole
Guess who's back? I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (oh no) Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
To the same plant, and the same pants
A rack fell and hit me at K-Mart and they witnessed it
When they knew I was produced by Dre
so i'm riding through the city with my high beams on
I was not afraid to die
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
And the pain spawns all the anger on
As if this ain't some bullshit
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again To all the weed that I've smoked
Lyrical rise flow, give back the tobasco
One slug
If I offend, I'm sorry! Please, please, forgive!
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game I so started
And now I'm fantastic
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than making another mothafuckin' "We Made You" uh
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
It's (high class) meets (white trash) Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Stumble hobble tumble slip drip
And make that retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
High off of love drunk from my hate
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Just go aah aah aah aah
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
Take a little bit of this fluoride with it
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
But up until the instant that I've been against it
Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,
And his girl Ha ha, Nate Dogg My mom loves Valium and lots of drugs
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
Everybody only wants to discuss me
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Because... This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
You ain't Detroit, I'm the D, u the new kid on the block
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
Young Money yeah uh Ah, throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
I'm cumming (oh yeah) Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
Maybe we took this too far 'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
I crack your shoulder-blades
He's lookin' around this club
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
and his alarm went off to wake him but he didnt make it to the rap olympics
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writing this rhyme
Why don't you like me?
I'm high as a bitch up, up and away, man, I come down in a couple of days
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
I'd laugh while you wept
Bitch, I don't give a two shits
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum cleanin'
To attack her character
Like who's D12, how we get started
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
Won't even get a cab for you and your friend
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
But you won't get a crumb from me
No one gave a fuck I was white
You high baby?
Oh, did I say "whore", Nick? I meant a liar too Like I've been goin' off on you all this time for no reason
A sky full of lighters Obie Trice
bout to get smacked back to the boon docks
I'm gonna let the world know that proof is hot
Or in the parking lot circling,
And still weren't found out
I get a master chick with a mouth full of adjectives
Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
Be good or be good at it
Then I'm gonna buy this fuckin' planet before the time I'm through
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old
Plus it's getting darker by the day
This substance equals cuffs
You don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
fuck lotto call me your leader
Twenty five to life I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
I ain't leavin' without you bitch
Didn't think I'd remember?)
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
We bout to have a party (turn the music up)
That's right (It don't hurt me) I don need you (No more)
Find the light, find the light, find the light Y'all know me, still the same O.G. but I been low-key
To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there
No not fuck, I said fack ,
But they might been around
Tonight I want a slut, will you be mine?
Your a supernova, and I'm a I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,
Diggity, bitch, you need to run and go get your frigity-friends
Let's cut to the chase, 'fore a door shuts in your face
Well I will you'll be in the trunk So long, bitch you did me so wrong
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not) The wo-world is my punchin' bag and
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
don't say shit, get your face lift
i feel bad that i gotta murder that dude from leave it to beaver
How I know? 'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga
And I don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at all
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Fuckin' all your bitches, we can fuckin' give a goddamn
End up with two back hands
We rolling circles and packs, we the lifesavers
But its real and cats is gettin' killed
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
You want what you can't have
Well no matter what the cost
You act like a motherfucker's brand new at this shit
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)
(Ah!)
You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
Am I too nice? Buy you ice
Born in a world going where they told me I can't go
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
If I hear Iko
I should download her audio on mp3
Is he nuts? No! He's insane! Don't you know what felch means? Yeah, well then tell me
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
Just leave me and love him out the blue
but those days are gone they're just memories
But I was put here not by accident
aint that annual annually knockin' the boots
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
A tragedy from fucking passin it up got to me
I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah)
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
And half of 'em ain't even funny like
Silly rabbit i know why they call you dat like you follow future
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
With that kind of rational man I got half a mind
Yes he can, can, don't ask me this again
Too a harder prescription drug called Valium like ya that's great
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
So spread your feet apart
That motherfucker can get it too, fuck 'em then
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
Hit the spot, spot my next victim
Found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it
Strictly to show they support us
Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'
Shake that ass for me [Eminem]
Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by
From in-school to before school to out of school
Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks
Shady's back, tell a friend
My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots, like this shit's hoppin'
It's all political, if my music is literal then I'm a criminal
And I realized, she was the crazy one
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
I'm addicted
This whole crowd looks suspicious its all dudes in here
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands(Fuck Marshall)
Then I'm have to take it And then after takin' that
I say move a bitch move So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie,
Had an accident when the Trojan broke Ah, poor baby
When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull
I started a moshpit, squashed a bitch And stomped the foster kids
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
"I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'"
Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
Was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind
Let's call your sister 3-way, have some threesome, me so horny
I'll walk away from it all before I'll let it go any further
One of you tries to grab a knife
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
'Cause frankly I'm sick of talking
I thrived off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
We're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
Watchin' this world pass me by
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
Start off with the Nighquil like I think I'll just have a taste
In a relationship, save it bitch, babysit? You make me sick
When I'm eating or feeding my daughter to not come and speak to me
And you could see why I'd be this way
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel tow
In front of cameras too (brrr)
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Not just based on my description
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin' shots off You bitches is gone I'm dropped in the club
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again!
Show me where the fuckin' studios at
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong Its fifty Shady! Yeah
Just grow wings and they fly, so
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
I ain't hear a word you said
Know that I was strapped with gats
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way?
Sittin' back look at this shit wow
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
It's got a picture, "This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya"
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
(You're crazy) I pop four E's at one time
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
This is 34 bars, we ain't even a third of the way through
I went from having my city locked up
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted
(Don't leave me!)
So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride
Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation, like I want that
The way she's grindin' that pole, I think I'm losing control Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm.
But I swear one way or another
Now step back to reality
Screaming I don't give a fuck with his windows down and system up
Marshall you never gone make it,
So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray
What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
Looking like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I gotta hole in my heart for some kind of emotional rollercoaster
Ey yo this song is for anyone
What's goin' on?
Inside your living room
Without you
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Now pop a little Zantac or ant'-acid if you can
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with Jergens
The center of attention back for the winter
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
They'll put you in a jail cell!
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
Everything is on fire
And then a world tour just to top it all off
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt! This is survival of the fittest
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Searchin' wit' a fine toothed comb
Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity Now was called Eminem but he threw away the candy
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to
One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
He shuts a whole motherfuckin' Walmart
Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
Smash these vocals and do a performance
I just want to be just like you
You and your husband have a fight
Every rhyme I say, a**aults you like an ultra violet ray
nobody's ever done it like i did it my heart is telling me to be different
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Was because you denied seeing me
You ain't gonna make me cam,
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage This guy dont wanna battle hes shook
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Find the light, find the light, find the light So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
And the lights go out in the trailer park?
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Full breast, ready to touch
"Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're lyin'
Baby, get down, get down Oh Amy, Rehab never looked so good,
And my night stands are full of open Bibles uh
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
You got me Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Trying to walk it off
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of Nighquil then I salivate
'Cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
This Guy keeps screaming he's paranoid
And these guys they can find every area code Bitch carry your own
so i'll end this shit with a fuck you and have a nice day {B Rabbit}
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
Push the whip see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
You gon either wanna fight me when I get off this fuckin' mic
Other words don't try to put the heart in a headcase 'Cause baby stable mentally I ain't I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm not phased,
When you was on my dick and give you somethin to smile about
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
And where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him
Talk a little spit on my ding-a-lang
Fat girls
(Oh my God!)
Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Bust a nut, get some rest
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And don't treat me like I'm Pee Wee Herman, this movie's PG
I maybe made some mistakes, but I'm only human
My crew looks for me to guide 'em
Your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
She used to tell me he hated me
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
I've been talking to God like that's my therapist
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
All this tension dispensing me, sentence is getting it
and i swear i got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
That's right (You don't hurt me) and I don't need you (No more)
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
What are you, pit, rott, mixed?
I need a new boyfriend!" Hi, my name is JoJo
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
Know what it's like
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon I ain't into S and M, but my whip's off the chain
'Cause ain't no such things as half-way crooks'
'Cause I obsess on everything and my mind is small shit
Oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use
(Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?)
So stop acting stupid, you so high
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Until the roof (Until the roof)
But I told Nate you was a freak
Hey, there's a concept that works
Hit the strip club don't forget once get your dick rubbed
Til I snap
And flew you and momma out to see me
I bet you he's fakin' it, I bet you
But things have gotten so bad between us
Kings never die I want it, I'm coming to get it
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me?
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
Missed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall
Its 'cause I am don't speculate spectate
Slim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies
And drop from my label and stop with the fables
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
Nigga you front you gon' get it, ok now maybe I said it
Any dispute, won't hesitate to produce handguns
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
I can only tell you what it feels like
With a night came to the matinee
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
Wowzers, I just made a mess of my trousers
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
"Yeah he's cute but I think he's married to Kim, he he"
Has taken four years just too put out an album B
Everyday's just a holiday
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen and dropped
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
but i'll probably still be the man when everything is over
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry momma!
Look real close cause strobe lights lie We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
"Debbie don't let that fucker get you upset
(Damn!)
I say everyday she be givin' it up There she goes, shaking that ass on the floor
i'm really too young to be feeling this old
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
If I ain't in it for the money, I'm in it for the P
What you say? (What's wrong?
And I'm not gonna be Here to stay
But I ain't trying to have none of my people hurt or murdered
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch
You've been driving me crazy
And so what if he did? it's none of your dang business kid. My mom, there's no one else quite like my mom
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
And how real is that
I can not moonlight on the side
But my grace and loose tooths
I can up and cock the hammer
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth
I think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm I'm so bad
Dre just let it run
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Its fifty, they say its Fifty
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
And this one begins where the last one ends
Tell her you need a place to stay
So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B.I.G., Pac
'Cause in a blink of an eye
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience That's nonsense!
Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me and turn me back to the old me Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
All the shit I should be hung for, and probably killed for saying
I'm on seven mile what the fuck was that
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
And the pants to match (Here mommer try 'em on)
To shop at K-mart and it became art
got the phantom out, no mats
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it
I'm about rolling a seven, when I toss up the dice
And try to get money out the drawer
What difference it make?
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
So one shot for the money two's to stop the show
i bag bad bitches motherfucker kat stacks
Sponsors workin' round the clock
Money outweighing problems on a triple beam
One moment
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
In order for me to pick that mic back up
but it didnt fall on his lap so he aint even here
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself see
Twenty five to life Feels like a close, it's coming to
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
Down and sending it to mastering to make it loud Enough dirt on you to murder you
Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Knows that she can say no but she won't say no
The Free World's got you gassed up
I was the one who they would blame it on
This is the winner takes it all so take it all Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I called it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in
Try to hold up and prolong these moments
No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest!
I thought we wiped the slate clean
My drinks is 10 around
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Lloyd Banks, Cashis, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50,
It's like the greatest gift you can get
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
I pay the lawsuit and laugh, it's not a big deal
Ha ha I'm the American dream! I'm the definition of white trash balling,
I ain't never seen a - ass like that
Play new games, say new names, ever since I broke up with what's her face
Caution to the wind, complete freedom,
When I get on the mic I'm a snap
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb mom beautiful
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
Being gay little faggot but by the way
But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with
(Well OK) Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. (Give me a kiss!)
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers It used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
(What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?)
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't goin' shoot you
I did get jumped, by all six of you chumps
That's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing
quit it, and made up a plane of bonkers
Kings never die I am not Jasmine, I'm Aladdin
Thought I said to wait, had four doors
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
To show you how much I adored you
You won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin' I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Never sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie "Kid")
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide
This roof is cavin' in
{Eminem]
Doing doing doing
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road [Intro- talking]
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
wack ass all up in my ear bitch bag back
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her
Too bad bitch, your gonna finally hear me out this time
I said saint, por favor
It gives me, the shit needed to be, the most meanest MC on this
My band You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black
So will the real Shady, please stand up
We run it, you do know but you actin' like you don't know
Who you think helped mold 'em all
A killer instinct runs in the blood
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?
On her massive Gluteus maximus again
And they blame it on Marilyn
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Down and died for you I no longer cried for you
Twenty million other white rappers emerged
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
I don't know it's just the way I am I'm so sick and tired of being admired
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
Shut the fuck up!
But they tell you put hands up
What's your sign
And just know that I grow cold of the older I grow
From principal to the student body and counselor
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
D-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round And he came to the club tonight
Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertaining
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday it's just so grey and black
How many hot verses till you bitches start acknowledging
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin' to blow it
Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
aye bitch, hey! There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
A little did I mention, that Jennifer's in
I'm right back on 'em, with the
If you ain't been through nothing
And my keys, to my ranch, I just bake cookies
yeah
Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record
Critics'll end up in critical
I'm basically 30, amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
If y'all can quit popping off at the jaws with the knocking
'Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut
I went from powdered milk and Farina
Shake that ass for me,
Nick, I ain't never seen a ass like that
Though I ain't wrapped tight
You gon' blow that rape whistle on me
You know, I love you 
two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
Lonely roads, God only knows
You waited this long to stop debating
He's scared to look in his fuckin yearbook, fuck Cranbrook Fuck a beat, i go acapella
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Next ho froze and it look like I walked in to a jewelry store
Show out on a track with me but it'd actually
Everyone report to the dance floor
(Boys, boys, boys, boys, boys, boys) When I just a little baby boy
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
Right at you So after a year and six months, no longer me that you want
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
That's the sound of the glock
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
fucking with lotto dawg you gotta be kiddin'
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
And I don't need water when I'm swallowing mine
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
Don't mean to ruin your plans
It's shady
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
(Squee!) I love it
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
I'll be your savior from
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
Oh boy you drive me crazy
I understand, this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!
Jessica rest assure, Superman's here to rescue ya
you need to get your cranium checked
I promise!
Or come to grips, with the fact that
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
Keep my entourage with me, baby I'll make a promise
The stress has been eating me, recently
I go the machete from O.J.
Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
We ain't nothing but mammals,
Cause what goes up must come down
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
You signed me up to battle?
Now tell me what kind of mother would want to see her
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
I'm cumming (oh yeah) Oh wow, boo that pow, ooh ow I need a cigarette now!
These industry niggaz ain't friends, they know how to pretend Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Put your mother fucking hands uplook, look Now while he stands tough
I took my bruises, took my lumps
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
Maybe we took this too far I went in headfirst
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
That's gotta count for something Listen girly, surely you don't want me to talk about
Yo I'm tellin' you dawg I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
"I followed you daddy
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's her soldier
You do know but actin' like you don't know Now homie I say I run (it run) it 'cause I'm in control
No taste buds, hoe later
It's just us, nobody else!
So He must be hearing shit
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
But thank you for staying April, I'm a make you learn
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
I love these hoes
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
i'll get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow(ohhhhhhhhh) Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
So I'm coming home tonight
Second base? What the fuck you tell Nick, punk?
"Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it"
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
I just wanna get high like you
I said you don't, want to fuck with Shady (cause why?)
And caught her stealin' my music,
Don't have no answers so pass the joint
I think he's about to flip
(Shit that's the clique we beefin' wit I swear)
And I love it, wait
Competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Almost gave up, I was like "Fuck it"
Alright ma, you win I don't feel like arguin'
Not over this shit (Stop!)
Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions
All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole
That's when I wake up
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, and what the fuck do you got?
I'm a piece of fuckin' white trash I say it proudly
I am what I am but I'm strong to be finished with me Valium spinach
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
Shady, Aftermath
That will do whatever the fuck
Flippin' the you know who "yeah, but he's so cute though"
Fack I'm gonna,
And color a fuckin' zebra My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
Let's go!
So you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knocks (Turn up!)
He sags his pants, do rags and a stocking cap
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I turned pop
So i'm a german eh?
i used to like that show now you got me in fight back mode
Now shut the fuck up and get what's comin' to you
Man fuck this shit; yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
And I can say that and you'll laugh
Speed, shrooms, down the Valium
I said I smell something in the air that's making me high Ok here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, I'm so la-di-da so
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Now look
Hypnotic, Hennessey, a couple shots of Patron
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
With a lamp post, door handle shutter
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids? Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it! (You're right!)
I'm sellin' hatred buffet style all the s*** you can eat
I'm a hustler, I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid
Why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Let's all stand up My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Why am I so differently wired in my nogging?
Nah fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
No labels wanted to sign me
Well some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes.
Here, tell these people somethin' they don't know about me Mm
With all of this nonsense it's constant, and "oh it's his lyrical content!"
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mofuckin' hos
He's tryna d-dr-drown Shawty, when you dance
"Daddy where's mommy?
I ran and got my 38 I hope its not to late [Chorus] (Nigga I been tryna call you all day motherfucker where you at?)
"But Slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird?"
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
I stunt I style I flash the shit
get your camera out uh, one flash
My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called My Salsa
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
So take it all So get your ideas, stack your ammo
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
I'm cleaning out my closet Can we pretend that airplanes
Shaddy I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah fucked in the head
It's on manual
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
Damn, I think Kim Kardashians a man
Like a fucking Terrier hittin' it
I poured my heart out to you,
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
I wanna fuckin' sing
His son just woke up and he just walks in
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
It's the return of the "Oh wait, no way, your kidding,
She panics and he gets his throat cut
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
What else is new f*** it what would Elvis do in your shoes
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So the F-C-C won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate
Until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both
He ain't got shit to do with it
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Out-rhyming everyone, God just give me one shot
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
He does not mean to lesbian offend
Outsider stomach growl, throbbing hunger
If I let you run alongside the Humvee
(And you don't hurt me)
If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until
So I'm more intect, tryna get on the map
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed
But no matter how many fish in the sea
(Where'd everybody go?) This is survival of the fittest
But I already told you my whole life story
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
'Cause you're my mama I guess we are who we are
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first.
But you have to walk a thousand miles In my shoes, just to see
Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't,
Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame
I'll do it, pop it gobble it and start wobblin'
Yo Slim Shady, come break these motherfuckers off Yo tell the world to hold their breath, they're breathing the wrong air
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
'Cause that's just the way she was They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
Like whatever they say has no bearing
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?
last so i'll
Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off
Who you think brought you the oldies
Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
One day I was walking by
That I'll be his resurrection
Now what you say?
Forget him or your gonna end up in the hospital again
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
Get her ass on the couch before she passes out Fuck that, someone help Denaun
I fucked her, I feed her fast food, you keeping her icy
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
With you I have zero strength
On this earth 'cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
Sit up front
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too.
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
Slim Shady Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
We're all we got in this world
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
We clutch
I could run circles around you so fast
Because I put my faith in my new girl
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
With nothin' to gain
'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
'Cause these others lowkey with the snaking faking
I remember signing my first deal and now I'm the second best I can deal with that
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
And pull you apart from both angles
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
at his fucking yearbook, fuck Cranbrook Fuck a beat, I go a cappella
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Next time you'll show restraint
Now my respect I demand it
Turns right around and bites you
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
'Cause you feed me fables from your hand
Calling men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy
Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin'
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
Superman video I was in the back
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh huh!)
Pee in a tea-cup? Bitch you ain't my keeper
take sum real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
Bitch, shut the fuck up before I put all them phone calls out You made to my house when you was wild-n-out before Nick
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
What year is this?

And take off their underpants
The way I knock em outta they shoes
Duba duba teletubie fella's what? fella's yeah?
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' slut
I bet he probably just want's to see how upset you would get
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh! I got you caught up in the rapture
Twisted Brown gets down with no assistance
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
What now nigga what now what
Kick back while I kick facts
And it's tonight, now go out and show em that you love 'em before it's too late"
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
Pajama time
I ain't never seen an ass like that
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!) Goddammit I'm sick of this group
How did you get to Sweden?
How 'bout that I'm somehow now back to the underdog
From the second I was born my momma lost me
I don't want to die yet
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
We're the ones who made you And that's why, my love, you'll never live without,
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass! I wanted a album so rugged nobody could touch it
Oh don't do that, don't, stop
i'm turned up i can't feel my face so My heart is telling me to be different
(Sorry!)
Whatever's got into me I don't mind Your dreams of getting the pill, you are literally getting the chills
Fuck you! Ha ha ha! I'm just playin' America, you know I love you A lot of people ask me
Look at Kim
Hang around drugs, loud music and like noise Slim Shady and Brown Trucker, another bunch of mother fuckers
I think I'm losing control God, come one,
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
mad as ??
Please stand up I'm like a head trip to listen to
And I ain't stopping 'till I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne
(Manning, Eli!) Ma, ma-ma-ma-ma, Manning, Eli
Am I supposed to choke?
So why don't you all sit down
Legacy, legacy First verse, uh, I'm on 'til I'm on a island
Bitches too! You ain't nothin' but a girl to me
Ow wait a minute, ow ow fuck I, I'm gonna fuckin' cam! Ah ah ah ahhh (Oh god damn)(Ooh)
I'm sleepin'
And when you acted up thats when u got jacked up
What daddy always tell you?
I ain't saying this shit again, ho, you know what it is It's a warning shot before I blow up your whole spot
(That's ill) I take a couple uppers
On the first week I did five hundred thousand
I feel like singin'
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth Bitch I'm a kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries And Harry Carey couldn't call my game
The plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes
You stare into your stereos eyes
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
If not then, chicks, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose
Man no
It's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact
The best part about me is I am not you
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
Glass is shattered from the fight
'Til they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
4 pac, 3 pac, 2 pac, 1
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on
But as days pass in this shit
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
i really can't see the end getting any closer
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
You're coming with me, feel it or not
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, 'til my hip don't hop anymore
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf 1, 2, 3 and to the 4
I like boobs, boobs, boobs, now see that gerbil, grab that tube,
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Wait I think I got it, okay bitch I got you, Robin Williams hanging
Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad
Shit I ain't even gotta try to shine
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Before I ever got Myspace
I'm a pull you to this bullet, and put it through you
Slash massive masturbator
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick!
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time To all the weed that I've smoked
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
(Baby)
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point 'em skyward uh
I know it's confusing you
And he said that I eyeballed him And if you fall, I'll get you there
Um num num touch my body
Pee, on the radio but I think I did
you're thinking like an alien, it just aint realistic
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I am white, I am a fuckin bum, I do live in a trailer with my mom,
I know everything he's got to say against me
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you I'm just so fuckin' depressed
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead"
And I ain't tryna be the nice neighbor
Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen Bitchin' that someone's always goin' throuh her purse and shit's missin'
Who must I show, to bust my flow
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
You want them when they don't want you, soon as they do, feelings change
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
But I've been true to this shit givin' my heart and soul
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
But I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
Get the top down, let my hair blow
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd vans
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
I love my daughter more than life n' itself But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
And we're starting this party from dusk Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
Til I have you at knife point, then you beg me to stop?
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
aw, t. raw i'm so uh
Get loose put some more of my juice
From a place that was dark as I was in
Jessica Simpson sing the chorus, Jessica Simpson When you walked through the door
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
I said you don't, want to fuck with Shady (why?)
I ain't never giving in again
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby"
Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
Nothing new since '76, Kid Rock
I go to grab her up by the damn hand and I can't pull her
Roxanne
Even D-J House fucked around and go shot
On the floor stacked against the door
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (ok)
So big my entire arm is a giant fire bomb
And I wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
That I can't get by with my nine to five
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse You've been warned if you've been born or if you can form
Third's for the bartender there's plenty of shots to go
Then I'll still be your superhero
(Where's Bizarre at?)
Man Cash, I don't mean to mess up your gal but
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
And they were instantly hooked right in
But we was kids then Kim, I was only eighteen
I need (a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life) It literally feels like a lifetime ago
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
Did I swallow hallucinogens, 'cause if not, where the hell did it go?
Then just study a tape of N.W.A
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
The mickity mack's bickity back, don't act wickity-wack
Put faith in lust, it ain't God I trust
I must be a-llergic to failure 'cause every ime I come close to it
Little hussy ass fusses, 'cause fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up
Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you Bitch I'm a kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'm a conceal you
If you read my mind you can see my pain
Just been stripped, I have just been vicked
Like damn we just swapped
The muthafuckin' spokesman now for White America!
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
Treat every women in my stable like flavors
And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
I said get out bitch!
I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
It's a girl
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
I can't take it, I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
Cuz once I blow I know that I'll be the man
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece [Chorus] I don't know dude
Tryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
This don't mean I'm gay, I don't like men
What this pretty little dame's name is
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
It's what you're suffering from when you simply don't care if its an
It's got a ring to it don't it?
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
Oh my god, for real man, not again I'm shaking
Don't make me wake this baby
So tell Saddam not to bother with making another bomb
Better shut your lying mouth if you don't want Nick finding out You probably think cuz it's been so long
Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
But I'm not sure she's the one
'Cause they full of shit too
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
I don't give a fuck, keep giving them hell
That I do all types of retarded shit
Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
I'm not looking for extra attention
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent Jay It's a f***ing miracle to be this lyrical
I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me.
(Swift, chill)
'Cause it feels so empty without me Kids! Lately I've been hard to reach
I'm a park my car and walk the rest of the way
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Fuck a Papa Doc
I'll make ya sit there
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant I'm standing in the flames
1, 2, 3 and to the 4
An upper class city having this happening
Damn girl I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
The thunderstorm has passed ya
So that basically resurrected my cash flow I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
And Wink did fuck my girl,
Fuck everybody
All the wars that are fought
The D to Flint who get sick with lead
Bitches they come, they go
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Thats a private school
I can get away anything I say and you will love it! The way you shake it, I can't believe it
Come hizzon what kinda fizz-uckin' position is that You know, you actin' like you don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
Reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
If i had something on you I woulda did it by now
And at the time every house that we lived in
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
I advance like going from toting iron to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
Mother fuck all your comparisons
Butt squeezing it's the season
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back I keep havin' this dream,
In this corner, weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds
Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,
Check ya wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
I love you too
Even if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino, it don't matter
Picasso with a pick axe a sick asshole
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
lets pretend, things woulda been no different
You're pac, he's pac, no pac
You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpses Jack Kevorkian"
And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as shit
And then I went platinum too
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"
My Valium, my Valium
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
I'm at a point of no return. Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
With a saw blade in it to make my jail break
D12!
Knives, strangling wives with pig lasso
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
"Please Marshall please let me suck your cock"
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
But I don't want to swallow it without chewing it
I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be, it's just me And I am, whatever you say I am
You want me to tell you somethin'
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
Black girls
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes (motherfucker). I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
I act like shit don't phase me
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
(Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear Feels like a close, it's coming to
Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
Slumped over bleedin', JFK
F-A-C-K, F-A-C-K, fack, fack fack fackin' freak me!
If she keep her dinner down
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
Brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz
But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed ya?
Your vcr tape cases with you Ambian CR great places to hide ain't it
He ain't so hot now is he?
But detractors just say (so much) for the Renegade
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote.
(I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsubishi)
I never drag 'em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to
And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates
Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy
I hang around big stars all day,
(What the fuck!)
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears.
When they know they're your heart
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage over headspace
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are I was afraid to
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
(BTOV) {nate dogg]
Fuck Cranbrooke Fuck a beat I'll go a capella
And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
I have no snare on my headphones
When I was bout to talk right after you
Would of ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
Drug sickness got me doing some bug switches
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't a said
And you can't see, the b****'s hair is frizzin'
We all fall down,
I can make her spin around
Ah somebody help!
Wow what the f*** happened last night where am I
You and this boy Slim Shady!
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back I'm about to lose my mind
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
I word bully I verbally abuse verbs like he did something to me personally
It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
Gimme the mic
Straight fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state
and have you lookin foolish like Chedder Bob when he shot himself
You think you saw this basket first?
HK to your chest plate
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
No more pain bitch you
you think these bitches gonna feel the shit you say
And no I don't need no goddamn psychologist
And the group that said motherfuck the police
Rot in pieces' aw that's great
Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?
I'm gone
State of emergency, the planets having panic attacks
A banjo and manhole cover
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
If this is my passion
now pretend things just make him angry with this shit
Bowl filled with hash, pockets stuffed with cash
I just opened enough eyes later on
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
And you can get the fickity-finger, the middle
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name These chicks don't even know the name of my band(ha ha)
Connected to a higher power
Love with me John Mayer so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
Slim Shady The way you shake it, I can't believe it
Would you rather get felched or do the felching
Condom on my dick of course it is,
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
Desert Storm and both of us put together
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Dumb it down, I don't know how (Huh-huh) how-how
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is something I never bow-wow'd at
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Can he come back as nasty as he can
I'm gonna blow the mike the whole night so strike up the f***in' maestro, I'm like nitro
Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is
I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I
What you think I'm kiddin' you?
'Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin
You know what man I'ma say somethin
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm posted up)
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Till Kon Artist slipped me some crack
Why does everyone always leave me?
So get this dick, I'ma live this I'm livin' life in the fast lane
That Ja shit, I tried to squashed it, it was too late to stop it
There she is on the ground bein' trampled
so won't be finished swallowin' my wad
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
I'm on top bitch and rock for tricks
I'm so caught it I almost feel like I'm the one who caused it
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
Kill 'em with meanness
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
They say I was running butt naked
Back to bed!
Don't ever try to judge me dude
Find different ways to word the same, old song
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Oh well, I tried
Please have faith in my words 'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, here
How I nutted early, 'cause I ejaculated prematurely
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
Oh my God I love you
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
Follow me around, and wiping my ass
Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
And why I just don't know So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting.
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
Lets let our love unfurl
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
You're only making this harder on yourself
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr Dre on the Chronic
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
You embarrassed?
Something I wont go until you toy with my emotion so it's over
What's it called again? I'm blanking
My blood type's the '80s
'Til one night he snuck in and said
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
I fell for this so many times
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
Hang it up, flat screen
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Go ham donut or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
Maybe next year, I'll say ass and she'll make my pee-pee go
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Started whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced
Like I'm eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Fuck him in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching
We could've, hey! where you going? get back here!
There's a four year old boy lyin' dead with a slit throat
Mercy, mark my words, ain't letting up, relentless I smell blood,
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berzerk) all night long
I think someone's at the door but I don't think I'mma answer
Shady man no don't massacre the fans
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My name is"
Today is a painful reminder of why
Put your mother fucking hands up and follow me
Makes all the pretty girl's wan to dance
Like I fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
(Just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
Dappadon Cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams
and there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
The way she's grindin that pole
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over TV
blah badi boo blah bah badi bloo blah
Even though you've lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
No boundaries no lengths
I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
You told me that you weren't leavin'
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
Feed it a fucking Aspirin and say that it has a headache
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
It gotta be acid, 'cos the X is gone Yeah, I took 'em all down with some parmesian
I be the mushroom trippin' sippin' shots of Jack
Now here I am three months later full blown relapse
Party poppin' shorty said she's comin' with me tonight
Let's get it started (go ahead shake that butt)
Now I'm Now I'm gonna make you dance
Not takin' nothin' from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Entertainment is changing, intertwining' with gangsters
I'll spit a racial slur honky sew me
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
My insecurities could eat me alive
So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos
i really can't complain, everything is kosher
And how I became hooked on val-i-um.
You shitted on me on your way up
Hope so, now ho Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (Go berserk) all night long
At least I know that I don't know
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
Quit crying bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
I swear, I swear man These chicks don't even know the name of my band
Is he nuts? No! He's insane! "Did you get him?" Naaw, fucker tried to bite my face off
She tac toe frozen six pack with exacto
Guess who's back
Fuck you looking at, hater?
Shit look at the bright side at least I ain't walking
Tall girls
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin I was bound to work a number on your back and
Khalil on the beat 'cause making the beat ain't the same
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now Aw look at daddy's baby girl
Once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
But it was X, and they called it "Pubic Hair on Chelsea"
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
And I clam up {*wham*} I just slam shut
In St. Andrew's hall not a stray slidin' all over the place
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
And opinions sway, I can hear them say
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
And it tastes like humble pie
If not then kick rocks in flip flops
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
Every fan black that I got
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was, was it
Yeah, yo, yo Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Try them trailer parks
So it take it all Only reason I dissed you in the first place
Bitch you make me hurl 'Cause I can't be your superman
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom My mom, my mom,
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,
snap back them ain't even rare where the tag a what
One tough act to follow, copy, one tough act to follow
You're coming home with me
I guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
And all he does is eat Dorritos and Cheetos
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Tightenin' around my throat
I like good pussy and I like good trees
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
Fuck it,
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
And we can (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
And she got hit now she yellin'
This is the winner takes it all so take it all I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
My mom probably got it the worst
Sleepin' outside the door waitin' in line
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-of-shit
It's off to H-E double hockey sticks I go I'm getting by with my wicked ways
Or you just got fixed, well, shit, then, let's lip-lock
But I never had no problem with alcohol
And I'm so lost without you
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
But it's just me I'm just obscene
The sky darkens, my life flashes
He sounds like Eric Sermon, the generic version
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
We run it, you do know but you actin' like you don't know You know, you actin' like you don't know
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't believe it now you're two
But oh its so fuckin' wet and soft,
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no fakin'
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Under your skin like a splinter
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Yeah Dre, sick track Perfect way to get back
Lord help us he's back in his pink Alf shirt
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
Girl, giddy-up, now get, get down
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Get the bar soap lathered, kangols and Carhartt, these Cargos
In no particular direction
And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'
Okay, I'm ready to go play
I'mma break that birdies neck
Daddy's with you in your prayers
Come be in Shady's world Oh boy you drive me crazy Bitch you make me hurl They call me Superman
My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes
Does Bizarre smoke crack? We can't get jobs
But you'll always be my hero
I like the sound of that, yeah
I don't even believe in breathin' I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
To the pain, the stress, the drama
Roman!
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
These bitches callin' me (Manning, Eli) A-a-a-a-all you lil' fagots can suck it
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Protools
Illest s*** you could think I would say
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
Doing, doing, doing The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
And all the medicine you fed us
I'm not Peter Pan, I don't fuck with fairies
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
And the window that was closing and there's nowhere else I can go with flows in
Stop, don't, I don't mean don't stop!
Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
So wipe the smile on your grill off,
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
I made it to the silver screen where Rocky's still what the theme is
Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby)
looking like a cyclone hit you
And that's not a stab at Micheal
And I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas (Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed
Real name no gimmicks Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside,
And although one has met their grandma
Look it's B.Rabbit
pretend he'd just stay outside all day
This guy don't wanna battle, He's shook
Sitting on a bike in the sand
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
Hailie, remember when I said If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
didn't you listen to the last round meat head
Do the job of killing Shady, then the karma will
Or shut the P-I-E hoes that peep my game 'Cause I'm about, like a f***in' echo
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
A visionary, vision is scary,
How could it ever be just us two?
But I didn't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
Its fifty, man that wasn't Fifty, they don't holla my name You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
Never loved you enough to trust you
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
Maybe some popcorn, and watch the show and just rock slow
Am I afraid of death
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
And I'm tryna make it to the St. Andrew's door
And while this is goin' on
Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker
He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
Superman ain't savin' shit, girl you can jump on Shady's dick
(I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes)
It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but
I just sneeze, but I just go atchoo then achieve! This is survival of the fittest
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
When me and Luis were trying to stick two CD's in the same slot Slim Shady, Slim Shady, I love you
My salsa makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
What are you doing?
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
Never mistreated you once
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Did y'all think I'mma let my dough freeze, ho please
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped!
But I sure would fall for that
To deuce juice
Came to party
I'll bring her with me when I show up to her crib waving
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
Kamikaze strapping a mother fucking bomb across me
There is no sun, and it's so dark
I'ma be around forever, entertain even in the ground
Because These chicks don't even know the name of my band
(Look baby)
And take off their underpants, my salsa
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
Hailie Jade I love that name,
But I sacheted around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
I'm about getting my logo off, flooded with ice
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note!
Nigga fuck my wife I'm tryna run and save my motherfuckin' life
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom My mom loved Valium now all I am is a party-animal
Other mike-o, stab you to the nightpost
I don't see what the big deal is anyway,
Oh God my brain is racing
Holding my tongue up trying to talk like this
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
No you think I'm ugly
Bet you could light your own cigarette with ya asshole
All I ever felt was this
So this must mean I'm disgusting
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you Yea, to my babies. Stay strong. Daddy will be home soon
And its just Too late for the other side
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Psycho on a cycle
You can see the sparks from hot metal
All I know is this much
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away {lotto}
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A., white Bronco like Elway
At war with a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Look, two pees and a tripod!
and it wasnt time to move and schools werent changing again
Please stand up 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
And we're starting this party from dusk And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent! It's bottle after bottle
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
Headphones on, straight ahead and kids tryin to start shit
Give me the keys I'm drunk, and I never driven a truck
So I'm gonna get what I got coming and the rest I'm takin' I'm shakin' like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit
Until next Thanksgiving'
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
They're all like "Oh my God it's him"
I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I'd poke her in the rear
cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
What do you mean, 'freeze'? Geez, I just got my seat!
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
Throw the match at the passed up place So feel the fire beneath your feet
Fat ass burgundy bags classy shit Jimmy Choo shoes
Boy, this crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
Nope, not anymore dear It cuts like a knife when I tell you get a life
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
And there's a million of us just like me
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' you God
I'm cumming (oh yeah) I never seen no shit like this,
Underpants
pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
Or I end up with dementia, but you rocking with a sadist
Uh-ah! Temper temper! Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much
To flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts
he wasnt socially akward and just strange as a kid
And it's cold, tryin' to travel this road
(Why are you doing this?)
Your superman, your superman Don't get me wrong
You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm
What else could I possibly do to make noise
I learned my lesson and cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more
They're sayin', "you got one more chance to do right
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul
The K, the I the D R O C K, motherfucker
Cause I'ma— Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
Thank you, God
And I don't mean rap
At all so don't grow partial
I think everyone's all jealous and shit 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
So you can lie to Hailie I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Elaina
I love you I'm getting by with my wicked ways
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath,
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
But this time I'm a
Don't try to deny it baby, I'm the only one for you
Then I fall in bed with a bottle of meds
Till I stuck my tongue on the frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
your still gonna sink
But sometimes this shit just seems
Fuckin' with my 2-5 up your fuckin' ass like my shoe size
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
They saying I must bring it as Mohammad
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this,
Cum I think my rubbers comin' off,
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
(Woo) I made a pact with the Devil that says, "I'll let you take me
Twenty five to life Too late
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
Just promise me you'll think of me
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
I'm lookin for a girl
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef You better kill me! I'm a be another rapper dead
I don't know it's just the way I am Shady, aftermath
You faggots keep eggin' me on
Ooh boy just touch my body
It was bologna was it the Methadone ya think
What's the matter dawg? You embarrassed?
I'll guarantee they scream, "Dre, don't leave us like that man!" cause I'm about to lose my mind
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong Innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Emptying full clips and bury your guns in the mud
Every hour, happy hour now
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
I want you to feel me like my step father felt me
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk
You better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here?
Bygones'll never be bygones,
(Let go of my hair, please don't do this baby)
To send my serenity powers
Well guess what, daddy's here
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
Since when did we begin to get 'dicted to dope
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in, the why, the who, what
You motherfuckers mustsanot know the tic tac songs
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
You front you'll have to get me off your ass
I got my baby, maybe the only lady that I adore, Hailie
But it feels so empty without me
Only time I ever been out and about is
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass
Just ask Jam Master Jay, they
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom
I turn around, find a gun on the ground
Now everybody from the 313
There's no way that you can save me, it's okay, go with him Hailie Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical
Forced to fight
Shoot out the back of his truck goes up in this motherfucker
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
He nose dove and sold nada
Serial killer hidin' murder material
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
But I'm running from it to be standing at the summit
but those days are gone [EMINEM] Alright,
I don't even know if I can say the word 'pee-pee'
I don't know why they let you out in the dark
Feelin' kinda breezy
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
So it's Shady After-mizz-ath back in that ass, you izz-ass
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs
Look at these rappers, how I treat them so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em yeah
Let Bizarre nut I take a couple uppers
Has an erection for me and thinks
I want to crush your skull till your brains leaks out of your veins
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
Then they anus'll ooze
you see how far these white jokes get you
Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
Here I'll scream with you!
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes, uh
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef Ha ha ha, I'm just playin' ladies
I am not afraid to die I guess we are who we are
Look, I can't change the way I think
Knife! Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
I don't see why these people always got my back
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
See me I'm climbing hell's gate
Forever I'm a be a Shady 7-4 Gangster
Love the way you lie I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
Have to be a fucking blowout to get me to retire
'Cause if I get burnt I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming
But not quite me 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
It go Ring-a-Chong, a-Ching-Chong-Chong-Chong-Ching
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
Trailer trash i choke u to your last breath
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
You god damn right bitch, and now it's too late
Between you and I
I am white I am a fuckin' bum
I ain't had no luck with this,
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
This is for children who break rules, people that straight fool
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
Haha Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
I'll tell the motherfucking slut to her face
But I get by my wicked ways, lady you can suck a dick till your neck aches
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
Ya'll are doomed
So I'm non complying at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
Niggas wearing flags, 'cause the colors match they clothes
(Grady!) Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down My tenement, too many now
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
And the fangs been out since then
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
Damn somebody hit me from the back
Whip out, whip down Tied him around my neck went down the fire escape of the Empire State
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
Nail her, 'Baby say hello to my little friend'
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
There is or there ever will be, disagree?
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers
So here I go is my shot.
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
But fuck it now I'm bout to draw the line
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
Yeah that rap was tight, but I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
Wait! What if there's an explanation for this shit?
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Yeah, right there, right there,
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
And walk my white ass back across 8 Mile My heart is telling me to be different
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies
Bleed! bitch bleed! bleed! So long, bitch you did me so wrong
Don, don, don, life, I do this for the crib
Up the center of the dance floor
See me and you we almost had the same outcome Heath
Ha! Ah ah ah ahhh (Oh god damn)(Ooh)
Hands up, reach for the sky
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
I dreamed of being that cool kid
That fit you, so put em on and wear 'em
That you might wake up with a guy On some new shit, I think I did too much
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
Like feeding Michel'le helium
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Believe me I'm leavin' a carcus today
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips I get all the money, pussy falls like rain
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
Who hate the world as much as each other
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
'Cause every time you do it's like an over load of fibs
(What about Eminem?)
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Decisions, decisions
You think that's bad you should hear the rest of my album
Then fuck it then break it up
Tell the public that I was so ugly
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
The only one who looked past
Swift told me to meet him here so its clear that this fucker
I think I love you baby I think I love you too
If I was black I woulda sold half
You should see when I'm stuntin' I flash the stones that be wantin'
Oh baby baby aah aah Um num num touch my body
We're in Sin City
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
(Please I love you, look we can just take Hallie and leave)
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
I'm like "My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?" White America!
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was am I?
I am white, I am a fucking bum
'Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
With his Karl Kani
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
At first, I'm like all right
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Tell these new artists that kings never die
Skinny girls
My brains gone, my souls warm, my spirit is torn
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go? I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
And I was not afraid to die Oh even if there's songs to sing
Haters started to appreciate my art
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
(crowd cheers)--- WOOOO Eminem (rabbit) freestlyes: This guy raps like his parents jerked him
I ain't never seen her butt like that
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
Just having to balance my damn self
Never ran with a click, I'm a posse
Got no ring on this finger now I'll never let another chick bring me down
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
I had to get Nate Dogg and his sing some shit Two to the one from the one to the three
(I can't I'm scared)
You can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
It ain't acid rap, I just rap on acid
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
Wouldn't even be taking this s*** if Deshaun didn't die
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
In the end I'm gone
Chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba
(Haha) Plasma
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
Who's that in the cool blue back
And be yourself man, be proud of who you are
Fuck 'em 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
'cause I want you triddip, yeah I be on that shiddit
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
Till I see some naked bitches dancin' around, drunk, touchin' each other Rum and Pepsi got your perception of me sketchy
Forget them other men, girl pay them little attention
1 pac , 2 pac, 3 pac, 4
To find his wife in bed with another man.
Man, I should of seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
But baby we're in Sweden
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Ain't changing my mind
Oh my God I'm crackin' up
i'm at a point of no return. Yea, (oh, oh), yea yea, oh I feel like dancing
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Look for coke to smoke No, oki dok
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixing our studio session
I got my baby back
Fuckin Nazi this squad ain't your type
Now it's blue blood in my veins
He's about to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Shady lose
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
And this load is like the weight of the world
With a about a million dollars with your mama
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
A poster child
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
Talk a little shit
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coping
The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing
I know you want me girl, in fact I see your grin (Now come in girl) When you walked through the door
I owe you for this one I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel
he pretends that .. [Chorus] can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
You do know but actin' like you don't know Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat
My children will carry me
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
And these niggas know I lay them down, make them beg
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willing to die for us
And you can never break my stride,
That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up
And a Heath Ledger bobblehead My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
And the lead singer of my band, my salsa
You do know but actin' like you don't know You know what this is
Oh but it feels so fackin' good! Ah ah ah ahhh (Oh god damn)(Ooh)
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
When I'm drunk as fuck
You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over,
Wanna hear something wick-wack?
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Fuck I was born during a earthquake To all the weed that I've smoked
Now bleed! bitch bleed!
But Lindsay please come back to seeing men
Gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
(Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear A shimmy shimmy go go motherfuckin' pop
And to the rest of the world, God gave you the shoes
And it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
A piece furniture, egg beater, thermos
I do it just to get your company hijacked If you like smack then I might too
I told him that you like it from behind Now, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this Nicki Minaj but I wanna stick
Wait I just forgot what I was thinking
And everyone just heard you let one rip Now I'm gonna make you dance
Cursed and blessed
And it seems yesterday it was just a dream
Where you going, I'm leaving you
You left me off your list Fuck you hip-hop
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
White girls
Little punk!
(Nigga what about your wife)
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod
Makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
You put your life in this, nothing like surviving the shot
Living in this world without you You really fucked me Kim
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
I know everything he's got to say against me,
But I guess that's just what sluts do
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,
So when you see me on your block you better lock your cars
Put ya face in it before I throw you in the basement again
50 told me to do situps to get buff
As you pour yourself another drink and I guess we are who we are
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I'll slap you off that bar stool
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, 'cause (They say kings never die
Serious
'Cause I'm gonna sock it to you, dyko, you don't like it
I'm as calm as the breeze, I'm the bees knees, his legs and his arms I'm a
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
Weed got her so chinky eyed
I'm kinda in the zone
Me and Shady deaded the past
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
100 pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound
Should I just give up
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girl's to take off their
Before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this And I would've done anything for you
And I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
Just sit there in one fuckin' place spinnin' in
I said look at him!
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas? I'm so bad
In 7 nights in the days and it's our Vegas
What size you where? I wear tens
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,
man they treat me like a legend
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Sprays one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,
Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuevo, first I kiss your navel
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I'm from Atlanta
Doing doing doing Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
And as you say goodbye to the grief
'Cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
I'm still standing here screamin' fuck the Free World Don't ever try to judge me dude
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Fuck a clock
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
It's lust its torturous,
With the ugly Kardashian
I say everyday she be givin' it up Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck
These leaders of the free world rookies
I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe that
No I won't sign your autograph, you can call me an asshole, I'm glad 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
"Shady what the fuck you saying?" I don't know help me!
But tonight, we're alright
Follow Bizarre's path and ran through it
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Shit,
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth [Chorus] It's Friday night came to this bitch right
This is what the fuck I do
I know you want me girl cause I can see you checking me out
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all with kindness
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Girl you just blew your chance
marshall youre never gonna make it
Even though I have an affinity for witty banter
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You don't know what the fuck i've been through But i know something about you
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So I've been sent here to destroy you
And you still don't know me So blow me bitch, I don't rock for cancer
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit you
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a c*** in mouth and get my balls blew out
Bumpin and grindin that pole
I know some shits so hard to swallow
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
and don't come back until something dope hits you
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
He's so stacked that he knows
Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's organic
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
We gotta take these cards ourselves
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you (ah-ha ha)
Motherfucker I'm grown
You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
Look at your husband now! (No!)
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, i say it proudly
'Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
Snoop said this in 94' "We don't love them hoes"
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful Yeah
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
tank top screaming lotto i dont fit you
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be I'm sorry momma
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe I know you want me baby
I did not even get to see Mary Kate's shower scene
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
Fuck you tipper Gore
You never wanted someone so bad ya sweating
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad!
and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
Shady sits on the shelf
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
And imagine him giving him an adjective an a** whooping
Talk to me
I can't call it
And I show no shame from coast to coast
Can you dig what I'm sayin' man, can you smell me?
my motto fuck lotto
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
For any nigga wid Hammer
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
And she begun to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet
quick someone get his ass another steroid
Psych! I joke, I joke! I keed, I keed!
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
I sit on top of you squeezin' til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But I don't need it.
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
he had a father and his mother wasnt crazy as shit
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
and he never dreamed he could rip stadiums
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
Red pills, blue pills and green
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Till I see dumb shit start happenin' Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms
Look at him haulin' ass I think he left his wife
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch and say fagot
Oh I'm so fucking hot, and you're so fucking hot,
4 pac 3 pac 2 pac 1
And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
Fuck what these cynics say
"Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem"
Come on kemosabe
You lil' brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
If she current I keep her pussy purring like the pipes on a lamp
yellow nigga, no cabs
Been there, done that, aw fuck it
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember
When I caught a guy
And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
Drop the biscuit (I will!)
Knowin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
People don't usually come back this way
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you like likes on the Gram
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze And you only live it once
There's nothing spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
We're the ones who made you So baby, baby, get down, down, down Baby, get down, down down
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady!
I'm an easy rider dreamin' of Wynonna I roam the country like a Greyhound bus
Tell a friend Now everyone report to the dance floor
I'm ready to make everyone's throat ache
Like I don't think anyone's real,
Maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show we love 'em back
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said
Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy
If you move again I'll beat the shit out of you (Okay)
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
Mind's like a pile of clay
Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
It's so appeasin' Now I'm gonna make you dance
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
S-superstar, girl, I'm ready for you mama!
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Until I met Dre
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
And bust open like broken water mains
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
Cause these others low key with the snaking faking
lets pretend, marshall mathers never picked up a pen
You got somethin' to say?!
get it back, give it back ain't 'bout shit
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
Brady's returning, matter fact I may be deserving
And it wasn't time to move in school no changing again
And get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
Go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
More alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You think I give a fuck!
In fact grab a six pack
First off you don't know Marshall
Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
You know the aim is to bang you
"I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock"
Just sprays and sprays
yeah they call me rabbit this is the turtle race
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
Mr. Officer! I'm already on my knees
Everything is so tense and gloom
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
I'm not guilty
A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
And she's on top, I'm gonna fackin', oh god,
Same shit, different toilet, oh you got a nice ass darlin'!
'Cause I got this motherfucking cloud over my head
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
You outta work, I know it's tough
(You're drunk! you're never going to get away at this!)
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
I don't know but I can tell you what they drove
Now you wanna run around talking bout guns like I ain't got none
But before I tie a rope around this nob
People shot all over the floor
After it bothered ya fathers
I am me, I'm a fire marshall and this is my Legacy, legacy, here
And why I just don't know Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do cause I'm about to lose my mind
It's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me You don't be fuckin' with the blue eye
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even hear it he pretends that Airplanes
Mary P., Slim Shady
You don't think so do you
Been shinin' like a diamond but gettin' passed as coal So fuck off
Like he got carrots up his ass-crack
How the fuck could you do this to me?
There ain't nobody as bomb as me
Fack, I just came again, okay pull it out now,
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
'Cause someone told me that
talkin about shit's creek
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
'Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
People will still camp out from the night before
Faggot, you think I'm scared of you? You gonna ruin my career, you better get one
I'm a take control of this relationship
See the twenty's spinning looking mean on the six
Even when you bitches are counting me out, and I appear to be down for the count
I'm out of control like no
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
pay attention, you're sayin the same shit that he said
To Michael Jackson activator
Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
Thank god I'm alive I gotta find Denaun
We won't quit until we're banned from existence Persistence pays if that holds true
I'm cleaning out my closet Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
So fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
How many times you fly to my house? Still trying to count
My teacher didn't think I was going to be nothing either
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years
And they need to take it up with me after the show
This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
If I hear another word so don't go opening your jibs
And broke his nose, this house is a broken home
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
Its true that I had a few
This guy's a gangster, his real name's Clarence And Clarence lives at home with both parents
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
'Cause I'm only giving you, things you joke about with your friends
Your tasin' them with like pages in
Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
How could you?
Used forgetfully so I cut class and ditch it now I fully rap Cadillac from a K Car, my a** from a hole in the ground, still can't tell em apart
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right
Even if it sounds corny,
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
"I dont like this, no!"
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
Fuck shots! I hope the weed will outweigh these drinks
Here, want a snack?
Jessica Simpson looks oh so tempting
Pretend he just made excuses that
Ow that hurts! take it out now
And I ain't leaving this party tonight
(Homie, they spent) Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve
You ran me into the ground, but what comes around goes around (Yeah)
Now I'm talking a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it
So everyday I have at least three stomach aches
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs
I must have got my pimping genes from him, the way he left my mama
But all you savage cats
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
bitch you can be up piss creek with paddles this deep
I can't even write a rhyme without doin' it
You don't get another chance,
Oh my, Em
But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle
I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
Nobody is safe from me! No, not even me
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm poppin' niggas tonight
And get up and get my own, I was never the type of kid
It's past time, like your favorite hobby
File you a lawsuit, I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now) (Dreamin', of fallin, dreamin', of fallin') Let's pretend like its '98
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin' As time passes, things change everyday
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
The same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells "Bitch!"
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want
You at a stand, still, mannequin
But your husband's heart problem is complicating
And wear it like a badge with honour, pass it around and share it
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby!
And forever we can drag this on and on
We'll be right back
So I guess it ain't
By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up
This G-I-A-empty hole in my empty head
Damn shorty, I told you this was bound to happen
I'm looking at your bum-stickity-bum, hun
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense b
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charlie Horse her
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
Feeling to me as killing the beat is
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding with you
Only deals I have is from the Sam's Club
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
but I'm man enough to face them today
Where must I go, who must I know
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
That you fucking had to be drunk to fuck me?
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
I love the way you lie [Bruno Mars]
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers Lickilty Split freestyle: Check this out, Check this out, yo
Where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Oh)
And scared to look in my eyes
You can't run from me Kim
I'll go handle this of course, unless you object"
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me, who dress like me
Inside it drives me crazy
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
With a gaping hole in it
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Doing doing doing The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this s***
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
And I'm coming to get that quarter back
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw-wit-da-baw dang-dang
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
You do know but actin' like you don't know When me and Fif' got together to do this music then move it
What, like I give a fuck, I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
'Cause, I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and him, both
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
Cuz he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Come on we're going for a ride bitch
Damn Slim, Mariah played you. Mariah who?
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
You think I'm ugly don't you
Too late
Something, something, something, something, I dunno Pop pills, pills I pop
And what I need from 'em? no favors (I know you feeling yourself right now
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Change the station I hate this song!
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog
I don't know why I'm still surprised
I could be iconic, and my conquest is
What, girl, I'm the crack-a-lator
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass! Sometimes I just feel like, quittin' I still might
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
In a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?
(And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving)
What you Mariah? Fly through twice
And heigh-ho, hand me my shovel I'm libel to dig my hole deeper
And though you say the days are happy
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
We bout' to have a party (turn the music up)
Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Thats ok you look like a fucking worm with braids
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
fuck it you can take the mic home with you
This couch, this T-V, this whole house is mine!
She don't need to see what I'm about to do
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Oh, I love the way you lie Now there's gravel in our voices
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Ha! go ahead yell!
(My penis in your anus)
O' Trice! [Obie Trice]
Living in this world without you Come on get out
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
And show these people what my level of skill's like
And said I was gross, go get a towel you're stomachs curling? Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassing me
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all them zippers
Now I gotta straight born infant
Inside your world
Born by whore lady
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Give a little "poot poot", it's OK (Fart Sound)
Then this thing turned out so evil
Right at you I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
Bumpin' 'Ice, Ice, Baby', screamin' Shady 'til I die
All I do is rap
another day of monotony Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
So i'm gonna turn with a great smile
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen,
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
I done said so much f***ed up s***, I was born a mistake
Damn! Mom
Get a grip Marshall
Damn.
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a
Now you bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Fuck you Ms. Cheney
Lyrics lyrics constant controversy
We're the ones who (chicka) made you The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Like her lips I'm agitated, aggravated To the point you don't suck my dick
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
And expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is.
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
Little bitch put me on blast on M-T-V
Got a 6 o'clock craving, stop, get Ciroc
Look at that, it's a Xanax.
'Cos our arms show tracks
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
Now what's your name girl
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers I'm suppose to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Show me everything's a blessing depending on the angles
I've calmed down now
When my grandma died, I realized I got an angel
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be! I'm sorry momma!
Shopping the demo with gun point
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
And to be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
You get the message am I getting through to you?
But scars still remaining the same
There goes another lawsuit
I'll call you again,
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I'ma treat these shell casin's like a soccer ball
Hipidi hoo bla
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer, or should I say Cobainer?
S*** half a Vicodin why can't I?
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it
I'm a man of my word so your fuckin' heads better nod
